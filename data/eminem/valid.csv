'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
"Gue-gue-guess who's back (hi, Mom!)"
This may be the only opportunity that I got
"Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it ? ""Wait!"
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
"The center of attention, back for the winter"
"If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan"
And that's when I realized you were sick
"I'm goin' berzerk, my nerves are bad"
"He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera"
"Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad"
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Kings never die
Whatever happened to wilin' out and being violent?
And just say that it ain't mine?what's my name?
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
La-la-la-la-la love
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
Everybody only wants to discuss me
I never meant to make you cry
"Saturday through Sunday, Monday"
That's how much we have in common (Whoa!)
And you woulda bought it
So turn the volume loud
I'ma wash away my sins
"This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it"
This is survival of the fittest
"I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans"
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
"Don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give"
"Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone"
"It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?"
"That you caused, ?cause I was so traumatized"
You better?
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
""
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
Its a beautiful kind of pain
"You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy"
""
"My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady"
"To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!"
End up runnin' back into them all
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
To take a stand (To take a stand)
"'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady"
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
"My apologies, no disrespect to technology"
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
"So everybody, just follow me"
I'll go to whatever lengths
"Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)"
Pt. II
"So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends"
""
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
But only when it freezes
"?Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit"
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
"All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me"
"I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl"
"This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home training"
"I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady"
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother at the same time
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
""
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
"Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy"
"And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline"
"There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst"
"And hit the corner faster, more assertive, never looking back"
"Bottom, it's signed by the Joker"
Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
But since when did this many people ever give a shit
""
?Cause here I sit in Lucifers den by the dutch oven
Put this in decks and check the monologue
I'm blew out from this blunt (*sighs*) fuck
"I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew"
"But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted"
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
"When I blew, see, but it was confusing"
That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Prr!)
""
""
I'm into stuff like doublin' commas
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word?
I'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
You get no love
"Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!"
But see me on the street and duck
"When I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to?"
A king-size bed but I sleep on the couch
"It's not up to me, we can only see"
"Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you"
And just pull that shit out of you (Yo left)
"Trainwrecks, sidewalks"
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole
"Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey"
I'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
"We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic"
"Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine"
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Probably rob these little dudes at fist point
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
And as you say goodbye to the grief it's like watching the walls
"Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it"
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
"I'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical"
"Takin' down my number, like, ""You still ain't got a new line?"""
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
"Of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it"
"She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ"
"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I fuckin' tell 'em make me (Bitch)
'Cause on the way back down I may
Settin' fire to yesterday
It's like you put a knife through my chest
"And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem"
"It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad"
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
""
"Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush"
Living in this world without you
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more (Ahh)

"Kick your shoes off, let your hair down"
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
"Im mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground"
But I'm the greatest
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
""
"Strap on, other words if you're gonna"
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
"And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script"
""
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on!

Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
"Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?"
A better person than I was
""
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
"Been a lover, been a cheat"
"I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is"""
"And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man"
"'Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't"
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
"Got your gal blowin' up a valve, valve-valve"
So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
"Step by step, heart to heart"
""
I'll be one tough act to follow
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
"You rodent, I'm omnipotent"
"As time passes, things change every day"
"Married to the game, but she broke her vows"
"My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live"
"And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave!"""
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
"I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away"
"Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller"
But I'm leavin' on this jet plane
"Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me"
"God, just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down"
To make sure I keep up with my competition
"And to think, it's just little ol' me"
"""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!"""
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
"Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back"
"Thanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*"
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
"They can all get fucked, just stay true to you"
"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo"
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
"Tyler the Creator, and Violent J"
"I said I'm sorry, Mama"
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark
But I ain't no Jesus
"And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me?"

"Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout"

One last time for Charlamagne
Pull up on the side of you
"But somethin' here is a foot?oh yeah, it's my dick"
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
"But it's ""Fuck the world,"" get a child out her"
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
"And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but?"
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service

"(She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more)"
Like I reached my full potential: I peeked

"Been a lover, been a cheat"
You want me to tell you something?
I said this looks like a job for me
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
With a bottle full of malt liquor
"Oh, shit, I forgot?how am I supposed to send this shit out?!"
"Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore if he gangbangin' or not"
But you won't break me
"Slim Shady, 2001"
"I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math"
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?

Don't be afraid to say no more
You are the reason that I made this song
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
Fuck you!

I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
