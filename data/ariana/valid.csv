"Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody"
"I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need"
"Wake up, wake up, wake up"
Ain't got no tears left to cry
""
"Yeah, we turnin' it up"
"Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep this secret"
"If I go alone, Im not gon' make it very far"
But all that I know is I need you close
And it's taking me a lot to say
"I'ma be happy, happy, yeah"
We're gonna be alright
""
"I got your body and put it in drive, baby"
Ain't no time to deny it
"And if it feels right, promise I don't mind"
('Cause I'm so into you)
It's all in me
"Give you the whole world, I'ma need space"
"They are so confused, who cares about their rationale?"
You get tired of my control (Yuh)
"And then you get it, get it, get it, get it (Ayy)"
All girls wanna be like that
Aint you ever seen a princess be a bad bitch?
How can they tell you shit that you've been through?
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
When the night fall 'til the sun come up
"I know you're never gonna wake up, I gotta give up"
"Listen, you got a man, but your man ain't loyal"
It's all in me
"Boy, you're my treasure"
"Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah"
All of them tears gon' come and go
"Danger, oh, how you hold me"
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
"Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you"
With my chin in the palm of my hands
"(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you)"
"You could hit it in the mornin' (Hit in the mornin', yeah, yeah, yeah)"
You've become my favorite sin
""
"There is somethin' between us, I can see it right now"
"Admit that it hurts you, baby"
"Got me happy, happy"
Good conversation got me holding my breath
""
Leave it all here in this bed with you (With you)
You're the one Im feeling as I'm laying on your chest
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
You can get whatever you need from me
"'Cause I'm so greedy, ooh"
I keep giving people blank stares (Yeah)
"I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah"
"I be fallin' for you, baby, and I just can't stop, 'cause"
"Thank you, next"
"Everyday, everyday, everyday, every"
"You, you love it how I move you"
""
Even seen boys come and go
"Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you"
""
""
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
"Sorry, had to tell you I'm a nice guy"
I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be
I get weak and fall like a teenager
"So baby, what you tryna say? Ayy"
But I dont want this time to pass
So when you walk out that door
"Blew it out of scale, like my ponytail"
Should I play Lotto? What's it worth?
""
"You can't imagine what I'm 'bout to say (It's a surprise, surprise)"
"I got you, I got you dreamin' (Ahh)"
""
But you without me ain't right (Ain't right)
Get it like you love me
"To bring the bitter taste to a halt  (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)"
"You know I be one of a kind, oh whoa (Let's go)"
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
"Highlight of my life, just like that Fenty Beauty kit"
He give it to me
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
"We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with"
"I say ""You need a real ,"" she said, ""Yes, Lord"""
"Everyday, every"
Think 'bout you all of my days
I don't ever tell you how I really feel
"You love it how I touch you, my one"
Been in this state of mind all night
""
"You are, you are"
"I don't mean to brag, but I be like, ""Put it in the bag,"" yeah"
Got me feelin' so incredible
You're my forever boy
"Stars fall, and the world goes blind"
"Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tell everybody"
"Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up"
"Then I'd rather you leave, leave me lonely"
And I need you
"My true love, my true love"
"Focus on me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Focus), f-f-focus on me, woo (Focus on me) (Focus on me, babe)"
No one compares
"""Dang, you fine, and look at that face"""
"Tonight, I'm a baller, babe (Tonight, I'm a baller, baby)"
The temperature's rising in here
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
But every time I think I'm free (Yeah)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
"Yeah, you turn me away"
You wouldn't let anybody speak and instead?
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
But the hard times are golden
"But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you"
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
"And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh"
"And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you"
I ain't even think of letting go
Call me right on the phone (Call me right on the phone)
"Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah"
And I'm greedy
"It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)"
I know that I'm coming tonight
The temperature's rising in here
You wouldn't let anybody speak and instead?
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
"I'm with you, I'm with you)"
""
Now I can't wait
"I ain't talking money, I'm just physically obsessed"
"A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it"
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
We decide it
This is the part when I break free
