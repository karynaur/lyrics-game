You dont need to worry about making me crazy
"'Cause Im way past that, yeah"
And so just call me if you want me
'Cause you got me
And Ill show you how much I want to be on your tattooed heart
""
"Tattooed heart, tattooed heart"
"Tattooed heart, tattooed heart"
"Tattooed heart, tattooed heart"
"Just as long as I'm the name, on your tattooed heart"
""
"Wrap me in your jacket, my baby"
And lay me in your bed
And kiss me underneath the moonlight
"Darling, let me trace the lines, on your tattooed heart"
""
"Tattooed heart, tattooed heart"
"Tattooed heart, tattooed heart"
"Tattooed heart, tattooed heart"
"Just as long as I'm the name, on your tattooed heart"
"Yeah, you really tried"
"But I was blind to all the lies you told me, boy"
All the shit you've done
"You can't outrun the way you undersold me, hey"
""
You acted like you bought me at a bargain sale
You don't even care
You focused your frustration on a small detail
"Blew it out of scale, like my ponytail"
""
"Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be"
"Then why, then why should I listen?"
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
"Goodbye, goodbye"
"'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away"
"And I'm taking it right back, hey"
""
"I'm no blow up doll, no free-for-all"
"No slave to your decision, ooh"
Gotta find a way to break the spell
To get the hell away from those who block my vision
""
"You used me as a fragment of your grand design, hey"
"And you, you don't get to put me on your bottom line"
"You don't get what's mine, and I'm doing fine"
""
Said you don't want to see the girl I want to be
"Then why, then why would I listen?"
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
"Goodbye, goodbye"
"'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away"
"I'm taking it right back, baby"
""

"I'm taking it right back, hey"
On that first day of Christmas
When you gave me all them kisses
"Boy, you showed me things"
"Come hold me, please, and never let me go"
On that second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
"So you promised me that promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy"
""
On that third day of Christmas
We got all in our feelings
"Said ""I love you"" and meant it, oh"
"On the fourth, we committed"
"Any time, he could get it"
"He's the real one, I know it"
""
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
"My true love, my true love"
You are my true love

"My true love, my true love"

On the fifth day of Christmas
You asked me what's on my wishlist
And I told you all I wanted was forever with my boo
After six days in your arms
I got that tattoo on my heart
"'Cause I'm your moonlight, you're my star"
"Ain't nothin' shining more than you, boy"
""
You completed the vision
Now I feel like I'm living
"You're so one in a million, oh-oh"
I'm so glad we committed
"Any time, he could get it"
"He's the real one, I know it"

You are my true love
"Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh-oh, ah-ah, ah-ah"
You are my true love
You walked in
Caught my attention
I've never seen
A man with so much dimension
""
"It's the way you walk, the way you talk"
The way you make me feel inside
"It's in your smile, it's in your eyes"
I don't wanna wait for tonight

So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
"About you, you"
And only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands

He was a mans man and a ladies man
"18, 19, I began to become more serious about things in life"
"Oh, I think when I was standing on that stoop and I looked at him, yeah, I was 11 years old"
