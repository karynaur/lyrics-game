You paint dreamscapes on the wall
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh"
"Keep your life, son"
"Dark side, I search for your dark side"
When I showed you around Centennial Park
"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time"
"That's what people say, mm, mm"
""
"(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)"
"It's like I'm 17, nobody understands"
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
And every day is like a battle
"And life was never worse but never better (ey, ey)"
"As soon as my rep started going down, down, down"
Crazy to think that this could work
"And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake"
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off"
And there's nothin' like a mad woman
"When she fell, she fell apart."
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
I never learned to read your mind (never learned to read my mind)
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
No other sadness in the world would do
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Are there still beautiful things?
"Body and soul, ooh whoa"
"Baby, I know places we won't be found"
"I, I"
If I could never give you peace?
And I had a bad feeling (had a bad feeling)
You and I got lost in it
Now I see
Touch me and you'll never be alone
The moon is high
Down a dead-end street
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
You're touchin' me
That he's the reason why
All you had to do was (stay!)
"I shake it off, I shake it off"
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And it's alright now
""
""
But I'm feeling 22
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
They told me all of my cages were mental
All you had to do was stay
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
With no one around to tweet it
Now all he thinks about is me
If the high was worth the pain
"'Cause I, I know places we can hide"
""
""
"King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa"
And isn't it just so pretty to think
"You were all I wanted (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)"
"In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah"
"Stolen kisses, pretty lies"
"But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong"
"It's you and me, there's nothing like this"
"I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't"
It could burn out
I forgot that you existed
""
"Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya"
Never took me quite where you do
""
"And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't"
Whispers
""
"The wedding was charming, if a little gauche"
"You told me about your past, thinking your future was me"
But who could stay?
"You're my, my, my, my lover"
But then something happened one magical night
Tying you to me?
"Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough"
"Even when wed argue, we'd not do it for long"
"Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling"
"In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
""
"We were flyin, but we'd never get far"
"I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22"
"I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy"
"(Ooh, look what you made me do"
Don't call me baby
Just close your eyes
You'll get better soon
""
"(This love, this love, this love, this love)"
"Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff"
"Comes back to me, burning red"
"All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting"
"so wondrously and brutally,"
If I could never give you peace?
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)
"Honey, life is just a classroom"
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
"I know places, I know places"
Rain came pouring down
I promise that you'll never find another like me
"This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)"
"Oh, oh-oh"
""
You asked me for a place to sleep
For the hope of it all
Are you ever dreaming of me?
"Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break"
"Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)"
Da-da da-da
"If I was a man, then I'd be the man"
""
"We are never, ever, ever (ever) getting back together"
"Stick with me, I'm your queen"
At you for making me feel this way
"Missing him was dark grey, all alone"
"(And fake, and fake, and fake)"
Got a long list of ex-lovers
Deep fears that the world would divide us
I know I tend to make it about me
I never wanna see you walk away
""
""
"I pinned your??hands behind your back, oh"
You should think about the consequence
"Someday when you leave me, I'd bet these memories"
"Shake it off, I shake it off"
And your eyes look like coming home
"We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything"
My twisted knife
"This is why we can't have nice things, darling"
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
(I will hold on to you)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
""
"Our country, guess it was a lawless land"
You need to calm down
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
You fight and you talk
"And you heard about me, ooh"
"And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go"
""
""
I brought a knife to a gunfight
When I still see it all in my head
"(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)"
"But when you get me alone, it's so simple"
But I ain't tryna play
"They are the hunters, we are the foxes"
"Uh huh, that's right"
""
"It's been a long time coming, but"
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
Now we've got problems
I know I never think before I jump
And you understand now
Do you remember?
"I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street"
Some to throw
We'd still worship this love
But if I just showed up at your party
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
They say I did something bad(oh)
The war outside our door keeps raging on
"I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)"
All you had to do was (stay! stay! stay! stay! stay!)
The rain came pouring down
You taught me a secret language
"My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust"
Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
"You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)"
""
""
"And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go"
That was the first time we were there
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
And I forget about you long enough
And there's nothin' like a mad woman
""
What about that?
All these people think love's for show
And all of my heroes die all alone
Then why's it feel so good?
And I'm so furious
All eyes on us
"It's a love story baby just say 'yes'"""
Right into place
But there was strangers watching
""
I'm yours to keep
""
So what am I defending now?
"At least that's what people say, mm, mm"
"You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)"
"Thought I??had reason to attack, but no"
In Wonderland
It's obvious that wanting me dead
"Soon, you'll get better"
""
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
This is the worthwhile fight
You should take it as a compliment
There's only so far new money goes
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
"'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play"
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
""
Which takes me back
""
What's that like?
""
And I don't think we can solve 'em
Ayy
""
"Love's a game, wanna play?"""
""
"Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)"
"And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth"
Out

It's a cruel summer
"And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End"
""
And I know it's long gone and
"Been here all along, so why can't you see?"
Dont read the last page
Sorry that I hurt you
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
"This love is good, this love is bad"
"To see you there, to see you there"
""
"I, I, I, I"
Under someone's bed
Like the other girls do
""
""
I get more angry
Lipstick on your face
"Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa"
"I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh"
Look what you made me do
"I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though"
I can dream about what happens when you see my face again
"Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go"
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
Loving him was red
You must like me for me??
"They'd say I hustled, put in the work"
"If you're anything like me,"
"In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams"
I know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you)
And I say to you...
And you love the game
"This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh"
"Flickered in my mind, only you"
Call it what you want to
High above the whole scene
"My reputation's never been worse, so"
""
""
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
"A dwindling, mercurial high"
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
You know I will
So many signs (you didn't even see the signs)
"I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye"
""
But I knew you
"I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home"
"I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')"
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
Now that it's just too late
"No, I could never give you peace"
""
August sipped away
"It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore"
"And when we go crashing down, we come back every time"
You'll get better
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
So I got wasted like all my potential
"Bridges burn, I never learn"
Follow (follow) you (you) around (around)
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And every day is like a battle
I go on too many dates
These are the hands of fate
"And you knew what it was, he is in love"
"My heart, my hips, my body, my love"
""
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
"I see nothing better, I keep him forever"
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
"But you showed who you are, then one magical night"
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off"
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
You hear my stolen lullabies
I need to say
"I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress"
The whole school is rolling fake dice
Just in case you'd call
"Missing him was dark grey, all alone"
"We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)"
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
I want to drive away with you
You were looking at me
"Darling, you're the one I want, and"
"You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends"
"But, honestly, baby, who's counting?"
So take a look what you've done
And I'm yours to lose
In burning red
And all the pieces fall
And the saddest fear
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
"Darling, I fancy you"
When I passed your house
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
No one likes a mad woman
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
"Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke"
'Cause I know that it's delicate
"I jump from the train, I ride off alone"
"Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah"
Look what you just made me do
And guns
"'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home"
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
The doctor had told him to settle down
Salt air
As you bury me
And when we go crashing down (and when we go)
Barefoot in the kitchen
""
I talk shit with my friends
I keep waiting for you but you never come
"In the middle of the night, in my dreams"
"Yeah, just take me home"
"When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink"
""
When you know you're 'bout to cry
Let the games begin
"And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)"
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
"Baby, let the games begin"
"You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho"
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
"If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right"
""
I'm only seventeen
""
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
And I don't think we can solve 'em
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
"We are alone, just you and me"
Religion's in your lips
""
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
Never mine
Be the same
But people like me are gone forever
""
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
"Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes"
"It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference"
I'm the only one of me
(Ooh)
Oh
I don't like your little games
"And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis"
"And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends"
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
So what am I defendin' now?
"""Your kindness is fake."""
"'Til you put me down, oh"
So I take my time
"Cross your heart, won't tell no other"
"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"
Nothing lasts forever
I have a lot of regrets about that
"So call it what you want, yeah"
You and I'll be safe and sound
Do bad things with you
"We just keep dancing like we're 22 (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)"
You gotta leave before you get left
"I, I, I, I"
"""Where we gonna go?"""
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"Salute to me, I'm your American queen"
"Now you try on callin' me ""Baby"" like tryin' on clothes"
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Look what you just made me??
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Ooh-ah
It's like I got this music in my mind
"'Cause baby, I could build a castle (castle)"
Hush
You've grown to hate your pride
The sun is going down
"Spinning in my highest heels, love"
We always walked a very thin line
This is why we can't have
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends
"Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)"
On your first trip to LA
"People started talking, putting us through our paces"
"Tossing, turning"
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah)
"I counted days, I counted miles"
Just one single glimpse of relief
"But I stay when its hard, or its wrong"
And she'll never know your story like I do
"Uh huh, that's right"
Hush

Escape this town for a little while
Cut me into pieces

"But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together"
As when they pulled me apart
He was long gone when he met me
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
"Most times, but this time it was true"
You took a Polaroid of us
My baby's fly like a jet stream
All along there was some
Invisible string
But it's not what I meant
'Cause we break down a little
"I see you everywhere, the only thing we share"
And I know your favorite songs

"Oh, no"
"You are in love, true love"

Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
"I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed"
"He looks up, grinning like a devil"
Something med school
"Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older"
You can't believe a word she says
"(Oh, oh, oh)"
"I remember you said, ""Don't leave me here alone"""
Meant just for you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

"When the sun came up, you were looking at me"
"You're my, my, my, my"
The masquerade revelers
"It's cool, that's what I tell 'em"
See you make your way through the crowd
"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
"Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said"
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
"You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you"

Don't call me kid

Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
In Wonderland
When I feel like an open wound
"I just wanna know you, know you, know you"
And I heard you moved on
Has really brought you two together
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
Before you even knew I was gone
"""Wanna hang out?"" Yeah, sounds like fun"
And I'm so furious
"My, my, my, my"
Yes (Would you run away?)
We gather stones
"I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)"
You and I'll be safe and sound
"I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit"
Here's something I've learned about people.
This is the golden age of something good
Or hide in the closet
"22, 22"
"With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it"
Don't you dare look out your window
We can feel it
(I know places)
Your faithless love's the only hoax
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
"But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and"
So it goes??
So I play 'em like a violin

Everything has changed
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach

"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
"They take their shots, but we're bulletproof"
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep

Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man

"Oh, how was I to know? I??"
Was what I did to you
The best people in life are free

I look through the windows of this love
"Take me to the lakes, where all the poets went to die"
That I'm talking to everyone here but you
Most fun I ever had
"The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me"
But I keep cruisin'

My baby's fit like a daydream
And now we're both sorry (Were both sorry)
"Sequin smile, black lipstick"
I say casually in the car
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
You are in love
Look what you made me do
"I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed"
"After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July"
""
"It's a bad sign, bad sign"
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)
""
You are not like the regulars
""
Who could stay?
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
"They are the hunters, we are the foxes"
And there's nothin' like a mad woman
You belong with me
"Ooh, ooh, yeah"
But what you did was just as dark
"Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool"
The light reflects the chain on your neck
These hunters with cellphones
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
"Easy they come, easy they go"
I'm a mirrorball
"Trust me, mine is better"
Everybody here was someone else before
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (mm)
"They say, ""Move on"", but you know, I won't"
"...here."""
Let the games begin
To make some sense of what you've seen
All these things will catch up to you
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
"Yeah, yeah"
Your integrity makes me seem small
""
"(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)"
Chandelier's still flickering here
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
""
I'm still on that trapeze
But you dream of some epiphany
"Boy, I fancy you"
I think he knows
"Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard"
And getting bitches and models?
"I want you, bless my"
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Say you'll remember me
"Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true"
"Know you better, know you better now"
Is it too soon to do this yet?
I knew I had to go back home
"Ooh whoa, ooh whoa"
I don't like your perfect crime
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off"
What should be over burrowed under my skin
""
And the rodeo clowns
"We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us."
Find out what you want
I promise that you'll never find another like
"And if you wanted me, you really should've showed"
For the hope of it all
You put me on and said I was your favorite
"Oh, and you held me close"
"My, my, my, my"
""
"Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied"
He got my heartbeat
"I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh"
""
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
It feels like one of those nights
"No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh"
I forgot that you existed
It's like I'm wastin' your honor
"Its on your face, don't walk away, I need to say"
"Like any great love, it keeps you guessing"
""
But it would've been fun
"Baby, we're the new romantics"
"My, my, my, my"
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
All I know is you held the door
"Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?"
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We won't be sleeping
No one likes a mad woman
"That became my religion, listen"
"It's time, oh-oh"
Keep your helmet
Shimmering beautiful
"Let me say it again, louder for those in the back..."
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
I've been having a hard time adjusting
And though I can't recall your face
Id be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez
You and I got lost in it
I still got love for you
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
You made a really deep cut
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
"I dont wanna hurt you, I just wanna be"
"And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate"
"I, I, I see how this is gon' go"
"You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you"
Ridin' in a getaway car
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake"
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I think he knows
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
Then I hate my reflection for years and years
But why's it feel so good?
August sipped away
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
Down (down)
So it goes??
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
I promise that you'll never find another like me
""
Got nothing in my brain
"It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because"
"Oh, you're the one I want"
""
""
"Chains around my demons, wool to brave the seasons"
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
"I, I knew you"
I think he knows
"Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool"
"Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)"
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
"Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied"
"And if I get burned, at least we were electrified"
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Cursing my name
Lipstick on your face
""
"Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa"
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
""
But they know nothing about??
All you had to do was (stay!)
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
But I can see us
"And it's ooh, whoa oh"
Who seems to care
It's finally sinking in
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
'Cause I knew you
"Yeah, we were dancing"
There's glitter on the floor after the party
"Soon, you'll get better"

"I was in your sights, you got me alone"

But this love is brave and wild)
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
In the darkest little paradise
Unless you wanna come along
"Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa"
They'll tell you I'm insane
I'll make myself at home
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
So I fly 'em all around the world
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
"We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding"
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Scratches down your back now
"No proof, not much, but you saw enough"
"Ooh, look what you made me do"
"And it's new, the shape of your body"
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
"Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all"
""
""
All you had to do was stay
(Hey!)
Mosaic broken hearts
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Ooh
Is it cool that I said all that?
All I know is that you drove us
I had a bad feeling
Persist and resist the temptation to ask you
"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
"Free rent, living in my mind"
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
"You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal"
Maybe we got lost in translation
""
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
The love they pushed aside
"Back when we were card sharks, playing games"
You're not my homeland anymore
"I never trust a playboy, but they love me"
Drunk on this pain
"With you, I fall down"
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Still worship this love
See you in the dark
Wishing I stayed
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)
"22, 22"
That this is me trying
(Are we?)
""
"'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home"
Got a long list of ex-lovers
""
"'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes"
Walking with his head down
Scratches down your back now
Touch me and you'll never be alone
This is a state of grace
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
"Boy, I understand"
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Echoes of your name inside my mind
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
And I never (never) saw you coming
I need to say
My hands are shaking from all this
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All you had to do was (stay!) (Oh)
"Magic, madness, heaven, sin"
Crimson red paint on my lips
It's golden like daylight

"If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it right)"
"I shake it off, I shake it off"
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
I'm drunk in the back of the car

Ooh-ah
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
I do bad things with you
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

Ridin' in a getaway car
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
Loves me like I'm brand new

"You found me, you found me, you found me"
Every time you call me crazy

But it's golden (Golden)
I had a marvelous time
"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns"
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
So take a look what you've done
"When you are young, they assume you know nothing"
"But I've got a blank space, baby"
Would you want me?
But we were dancing
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
"Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah"
"Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene"
Saying it's gonna be alright
"Spinning in my highest heels, love"
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
"And say, ""hello"""
I don't want you like a best friend
And when I break it's in a million pieces
"Time, wondrous time"
"Too many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh"

"Hoo, hoo-ooh"

Little did I know
"We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so"
"Soon, you'll get better"
I can make all the tables turn
This is why we can't have nice things
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
"You can tell me when it's over, mm"
'Cause it was never mine

"I dont wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)"
Lead to where I can't stop
I never needed anything more

Who's counting?
"I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)"
"Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado..."
Can you see right through me?
This has broken me down
"In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha"
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Meet me in the afterglow
My sleepless night
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man
Or I won't stick around
"You keep his shirt, he keeps his word"
(Stay!) Hey
"King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa"
"My, my, my, my"
"Shake it off, I shake it off"
You made a really deep cut
If you would've been the one
I'd be an alpha type
"'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?"

"I shake it off, I shake it off"
The first few hundred times
Is it too soon to do this yet?
You say sorry just for show
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)
"Trouble, trouble, trouble"

"""Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!"" (Oh)"
But it's not what I meant

And I can go anywhere I want
But every night with us is like a dream
"Baby, that's the fun of you"
"Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah"
You searched the world for something else
"Baby, I know places we won't be found"
"Never be the same now, now"
So take a look what you've done
"Lord, save me, my drug is my baby"
""
"Don't blame me, love made me crazy"
All I knew this morning when I woke
You'll be flushed when you return
My baby's fit like a daydream
"One look, dark room"
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You're not my homeland anymore
For you I would ruin myself
"I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)"
"That's what they dont see, mm, mm"
It feels like one of those nights

Can we always be this close forever and ever?
I would waste my time

I want your complications too
I'm yours to keep (Oh)

Look at how my tears ricochet
But it would've been fun

And I've loved in shades of wrong)
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
Just don't
"And you know for me, it's always you"
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
"(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)"
'Cause you know I love the players
And I had a bad feeling
Just before they lose it all
"It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold"
"And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know"
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)

"Killing me slow, out the window"
But I'm about to play my Ace (ahh)
"Don't blame me, love made me crazy"
"Cause baby, now we've got bad blood"
"Late in the night, the city's asleep"
It feels like one of those nights
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
We'll take this way too far
I want your dreary Mondays
"Oh, you're my, my, my, my"
"Like any real love, it's ever-changing"
"""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart"
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Those eyes add insult to injury
"And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play"
That I gave you
I wanna be your end game (End game)
Remember when I pulled up
All you had to do was
"Been losing grip, on sinking ships"
And when you can't sleep at night
You look like my next mistake

"'Cause I remember it all, all, all"
Change my priorities
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
Right into place
I stay out too late
"In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh"
"Now all we know, is dont let go"
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
"I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night"

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
But why's it feel so good?

Laughed on the school yard

That this is me trying

I don't know anything but I know I miss you
You should take it as a compliment
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
Shining just for you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Eulogize me?
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
"Soon, you'll get better"
Dust that covered my whole room
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
I'm dancing on my own (Dancing on my own)

"Uh huh, that's right"
And you make your ruthless rulings.
August slipped away into a moment in time
"I want you, bless my"

My baby's fly like a jet stream
Everyone looked worse in the light

Boys and boys and girls and girls
You belong with me
Picture of your face in an invisible locket

"All of you, all of me (Intertwined)"

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

I just wanted you to know
But what can I say?
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
You used to work at to make a little money

That magic's not here no more

And maybe I don't quite know what to say

Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch

And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And my wide-eyed gaze
All you had to do was stay
Under someone's bed
You look like bad news
"You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me"
"Who knows, if I never showed up what could've been"
"Stopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me

"So, shame on me now"
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
"Your smile, my ghost"
"It just felt so good, good"
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake"

Don't want no other shade of blue

A billion little times
We'd still worship this love
Will you have me?
And I can still see it all (In my head)

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
All I know since yesterday
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
No one understands
To dress up like hipsters
And if my wishes came true
"King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa"
Heartbreak is the national anthem
""
""
"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
'Cause I know that it's delicate
'Cause you have to
Ruining everything
"But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts"
To touch my hand
"Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates"
My kingdom come undone
They see right through
And we pretended it could last forever
"Light me up (Light me up), light me up (Light me up)"
Please don't ever become a stranger
"(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)"
I could show you incredible things
"Wildest dreams, ah-aah haa"
"Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?"
"You make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah"
"Oh whoa, ah"
"Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3"
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake"
Is it romantic how all my elegies
"We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)"

With all these nights we're spending

You turned into your worst fears

Can I go where you go?

Standing in your cardigan
I swear I loved you
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
This is why we can't have nice things
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
I think I've seen this film before
"Betty, I won't make assumptions"
Oh-oh-oh
We ditch the whole scene
Midnight
Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes
"My hands shake, I can't explain this"
You'd come back to me
"Time, curious time"
Remember when I pulled up
"It's you and me, that's my whole world"
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
And though I can't recall your face
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
They see right through me

"I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)"

And toyin' with them older guys

"Well, could've been easy"
And you find something to wrap your noose around
"Been here all along, so why can't you see?"

And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
"You knew the hero died, so what's the movie for"
I hit my peak at seven feet
Tell yourself you can always stop
"'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man"
And we see you over there on the internet
This ain't for the best
But what a ghostly scene
But loving him was red
I know places
(You say I did something bad?)
'Cause it was never mine
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
The devil's in the details
"Don't blame me, love made me crazy"
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
"Don't blame me, love made me crazy"
"As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground"
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
"20 questions, we tell the truth"
(Heard from you)
I never learned to read your mind (so many signs)
"When you jumped in first, I went in too"
I'm the only one of me
"This won't go back to normal, if it ever was"
The teams that picked you last...
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
"I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!"
And all at once
"Staring at the sunset, babe"
"Whoa, in Wonderland"
All's well that ends well to end up with you
My castle crumbled overnight
August slipped away into a moment in time
"There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)"
"I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)"

'Cause you're not my baby
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Love is a ruthless game
In your own little golden prison cell...
"'Cause I, I know places we can hide"
And stolen stares
"But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together"
Let me remind you
"I did, I did, I did"
Did not cover

"When you are young, they assume you know nothing"
Standing by and waiting at your back door

Last December (last December)
"Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so"
They see right through me
Off the road

Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

Had me in the palm of your hand

I was cryin' in a getaway car
Look at how my tears ricochet

Tell me that it's not my fault

"(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)"
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
And you should think about the consequence
I want you to know
Now we've got problems
"These hands had to let it go free, and"
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
All I know is a simple name
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
All you had to do was (stay!) (Ooh)
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
""
"I just wanna know you, know you, know you"
Youre my Achilles heel
The only thing I wanna do
Look what you made me do
I recall late November
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Is everything has changed
So you were never a saint
Jump into the pool from the balcony
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay
"You are in love, true love"
forming the words of a thousand voices
Or with a nasty scar
"We are never, ever, ever getting back together"
Would you have me?
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
"Ooh, look what you made me do"
"First sight, yeah, we love without reason"
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
This is the worthwhile fight
""
We were built to fall apart
Drunk under a streetlight
"Well, he was runnin' after us, I was screamin, ""Go, go, go!"""
"You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too"
"No, nothing good starts in a getaway car"
So it goes??
"You called me up again tonight, but"
""
It's all just a blur
(We learn to live with the pain
"Sir, I think he's bleedin' out"

Wishing I could write my name on it
Our secret moments in a crowded room
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
"But something happened, I heard him laughing"
""
(Talk to me)
Uh huh
He'd better lock it down
"Give you my wild, give you a child"
Even when (the) music's gone
"And in the end, in Wonderland"
Is it chill that you're in my head?
"We never painted by the numbers, baby"
"But if the storys over, why am I still writing pages?"
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
"And when I fell hard, you took a step back"
And I've loved in shades of wrong
""
"You said it was a great love, one for the ages"
Under someone's bed
Hold on to this lullaby
""
"Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3"
Take me home
And if my wishes came true
"In the middle of the night, in my dreams"
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
At least I'm trying
"Darling, you're the one I want, and"
It was so nice throwing big parties
Look what you just made me do
You made a really deep cut
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Comes creeping in
And I will hold on to you
Yeah

The role you made me play
"Screaming, crying, perfect storms"
"And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)"
Because you break them
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
"And that's what they dont see, mm, mm"
Love is a ruthless game
Do bad things with you
Scratches down your back now

"No, nothing good starts in a getaway car"

Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
"And it's just around the corner, darlin'"
So please show me Hackney
"Say, say that we got it"
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake"
Hand under my sweatshirt
Say my name and everything just stops
Even if it's a false god
"My rebounds, my earthquakes"
For the hope of it all
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year
Even when I lose my mind
Look what you just made me do
""
"You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type (You my type)"
"For names you'll never speak again,"
But you can make me a drink
When they sent home the horses
"It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore"
They say I did something bad
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I want to watch wisteria grow
"We are never, ever, ever getting back together"
""
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You heard the rumors from Inez
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
"You are in love, true love"
"Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah"
Does she smile?
"Like it was the first time, first time (first time, first time)"
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
(Knew it right there)
"Ha, ah, ah"

Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
But I know I miss you
All I know since yesterday
Skipping down 16th Avenue
"And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for"
""
Think I'm finally clean
"I'm settin' off, but not without my muse"
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patr??n

"Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too"
You could've been getting down
Not because he owns me
I'd be the man
"It's cool, that's what I tell 'em"
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
"I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue"
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
I needed a reason
Can we always be this close?
"Oh, are you ready for it?"
Now I send their babies presents
And here's to my mama
"We could follow the sparks, I'll drive"
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Hung my head as I lost the war
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
I'm the one he's walking to
"So, come on, come along with me"
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
I think I've seen this film before
You'll get better soon
In Wonderland
"Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes"
And when we've had our very last kiss
"You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes"
"Yeah, I want you"
Body like it's mine
Ooh-ah
"Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (Mmhm)"
"In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams"
It's poker
So we went on our way
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
The devil's in the details
"If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right"
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
Kissing in my car again

And I think you should come live with
"Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you"
"We're so sad, we paint the town blue"
Would it be enough
High heels on cobblestones
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
"You knew you won, so what's the point of keeping score?"
And I just wanted you to know
"Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?"
"(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh!)"
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
""
Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
"Here you are now, calling me up"
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
"I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere"
"Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it"
Watch you breathin' out (out)
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
To make you feel like what we had
"New money, suit and tie"
"To see you there, to see you there"
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
"And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake"
"And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away"
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
""
""
"I can see you starin', honey"
I want auroras and sad prose
And I had a bad feeling
Flew me to places I'd never been
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in

And it smells like me
But you keep my old scarf

I can't speak with anyone else

"We could follow the sparks, I'll drive"
"I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)"

Over the creek
Will you love me?
A friend to all is a friend to none
"I want you, bless my"
"So, so, so it goes"
I'm the one who burned us down
"All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting"
"I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
"This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh"
And you wanna scream

"Without me, without me, without me"
"I'd be a bitch, not a baller"
I had to take them
"And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)"
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
I did a number on you
"That someday we're gonna (Win), just thought you should know"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
"And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't"
"And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate"
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
'Cause you were never mine
I'd like to be my old self again
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
Say you'll see me again
Everyone thinks that they know us
Tried to change the ending
Your braids like a pattern
"Ooh, look what you made me do"
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
(And here's to my real friends)
"So, so, so it goes"
So who am I offending now?
"You should see the things we do, baby"
'Cause you know I love the players
"Combat, I'm ready for combat"
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
"His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room"
"Baby, let the games begin"
Any time I wanted
Chasing shadows in the grocery line
"When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe"

That this is me trying (maybe I don't quite know what to say)
"I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you"
Like he's just your understudy
I just wanna know you better

You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
You're a flashback in a film reel
'Til my dying day
"Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend"""

I can feel the flames on my skin
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think

"I reached for you, but you were gone"
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
"It's new, the shape of your body"
Help me hold on to you
"""I rent a place on Cornelia Street"""
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
About why you switched your homeroom
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Unless you play it good and right

"And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em"
And laugh when you're nervous.
"In my defense, I have none"
"But we were something, don't you think so?"
And I was just drinkin

Walking with his head down
When I'm screaming at the sky
Carve your name into my bedpost
Sweet tea in the summer
"Cause baby, now we've got bad blood"
And end up dreaming
No other sadness in the world would do
"Holding my breath, slowly, I said"
With you
"Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying"
Leading us home
Say you'll remember me
"We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)"
We'll move to India forever
But we were dancing
Think about the place where you first met me
"Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known"
""
"I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that"
"Betty, right now is the last time"
And you find something to wrap your noose around
"Cause baby, now we've got bad blood"
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
Just a flesh wound
I watched you leave

You showed me colors you know
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
"So, so, so it goes"
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
"Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes"
"(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)"
But we were dancing
Your necklace hanging from my neck
"I, I loved you in secret"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
"I, I knew you"
Now we've got problems
And we run
"I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers"
(This love)
Look what you just made me do
We'd still worship
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
"These hands had to let it go free, and"

Flashbacks waking me up
"Baby, let the games begin"
"You're the one I want, one I want"
"Oh, oh-oh"
It's a cruel summer
Just playthings for me to use
"Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours"
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
All I know since yesterday
Good wives always know
"I guess you never know, never know"
Oh-oh
"I got that, ah, I mean"
"The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me"
I forgot that you existed
You and I
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes

I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
I remember thinking I had you
Out
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
"Like the colors in autumn, so bright"

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
You are somebody that I don't know
"I can see you standin', honey"
"Come here, you can meet me in the back"
"Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby"

"When we decided, we decided"
I believe in
"Cross my heart, won't tell no other"

I once believed love would be (Black and white)
Only twenty minutes to sleep
Look what you just made me do
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (Yeah)"
"This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh"
"Spinning in my highest heels, love"
"Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Did you have to do this?
22 (dancing like)
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake"
"Light pink sky, up on the roof"
"Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?"
And Ill never be the same

Playin' hide-and-seek and
Invisible string

"'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter"
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

No one has to know
"Who could ever leave me, darling"
"If life gets too good now,"

"Take me to the lakes, where all the poets went to die"

But we figured you out
Like can you just not step on our gowns?

"Missing him was dark grey, all alone"
Every time you call me crazy
"And all at once, you are the one"
Carve your name into my bedpost
We both went mad
And clandestine meetings
"I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends"
All the words to your old favorite song
"Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied"
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
And longing stares
But I got your heart
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
Isn't it?
Those days turned into nights
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
They once belonged to me
Look what you made me do
"""without your past,"

And I remember thinking
Id be the man
Burning red
"Big reputation, big reputation"
There will be just reputation.
"Or does she mouth, ""Fuck you forever""?"
"We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)"
Theres glitter on the floor after the party
"Wary of phone calls and promises,"
My name is whatever you decide
The night we couldn't quite forget

Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
Sleeping in tents
"So, so, so it goes"
Standing in a nice dress

"We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip."
"It's time, oh-oh"
I just forget what they were
And whispers turned to talking
Walking with his head down
"Would've been right there, front row"
Ros flowing with your chosen family
"'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello"""
""
"I guess you never know, never know"
And I didn't like the ending
""
I take the long way home
"Light me up, go ahead and light me up (Light me up)"
"Baby, we're the new romantics"
""
And realizing there's no right answer
""
"And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover"
You know it used to be mad love
""
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
But the rain is always gonna come
"(To the memories, they will hold on to you)"
Please picture me
"Any promises now, can we, babe?"
""
Now that it's just too late
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
"I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one"
"Ooh, look what you made me do"
I look through the windows of this love
"We hang back, it's all in the timing"
"Fade into view, oh"
But one of these things is not like the others
We found Wonderland
(Yeah)
"I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go"
(I can never look away)
"You are in love, true love"
"You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you"
""
Passed down like folk songs
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
""
So peaceful and quiet
Ooh-ah
"'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"
"And we pretended it could last forever (ey, ey)"
""
""
"So, shame on me now"
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Tell me that I'm all you want
"'Cause you were never mine, mine"
"Cherry lips, crystal skies"
No cameras catch my pageant smile
"Wrap your arms around me, baby boy"
""
"I want you, bless my soul"
All this time (so many signs)
Just wanna be with you
Saying it's gonna be alright
Slept next to her but
Think I'm finally clean
"You know I'm not a bad girl, but I"
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
Some to make a diamond ring
"(Oh, oh)"
"You can tell me when it's over, mm"
Even if nobody came to your show
But you'll come back each time you leave
Take the road less traveled by
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
"And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)"
"(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)"
""
I'm only seventeen
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
"And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)"
(Stay!) Hey
"Staring at the sunset, babe"
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
All the drama queens taking swings
Is it too soon to do this yet?
"I close my eyes, and the flashback starts"
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
"One night, he wakes"
All you had to do was (stay!)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
"Years ago, we were just inside"
""
'Cause us traitors never win
"Oh, oh-oh"
Burned the disco down
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
""
I have a lot of regrets about that
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
I'm still a believer but I don't know why
You know I love a London boy
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
So take a look what you've done
"You're the one I want, one I want"
Is it cool that I said all that?
"I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be"
I hope I never lose you
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
"Call it what you want, yeah"
The whole weekend
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh"
""
But I can't make them stay
"And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows"
""
Each new enemy turns to steel
Give you my best
All you had to do was (stay!)
Too well
"Baby, like we stood a chance"
All I know is a new found grace
Watch you breathin'
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
I'm not your problem anymore
""
I just wanna know you better
"Yeah, we were dancing"
"Baby, we're the new romantics"
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
And so it goes
You can see it with the lights out
"And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)"
In the garden would you trust me
You knock on wood every time you make plans.
""
"I'm settin' off, but not without my muse"
Let the games begin
I just pretend it isn't real
'Cause look at your face
"But they lie, and they lie, and they lie"
"The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'."
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
You'll be alright
"Shake it off, I shake it off"
American glory faded before me
Lived in??the??shade you were??throwing
Everything will be alright if (ooh) you keep me next to you
I hit the Sunday matinee
"Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah"
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
"Darling, you're the one I want"
"Hey, it's all me, in my head"
"I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans"
Marked me like a bloodstain
I'm still trying everything
"And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)"
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
You and I got lost in it
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
"You cross your fingers, hold your breath,"
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (never gave a warning sign)
And losing on card game bets with Dal
"But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom"
"Know you better, know you better now"
Even if it's just in your
I couldn't turn things around (you never turned things around)
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Not just the idea of something.
"Soon, you'll get better"
The whole school is rolling fake dice
But we were in screaming color
"'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave"
I'll get you out on the floor
because that's what they want from you.
To forget why I needed to
Laughin' but the joke's not funny at all
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
"Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard"
And I will
"And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)"
It feels like one of those nights
Put you in jail for something you??didnt??do
"In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha"
And life was never worse but never better
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
"No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh"
And it said
And I've been meaning to tell you
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
"'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
"Darling, later on you will thank your stars"
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
Swaying as the room burned down
You wear the same jewels
I would lose my mind
And then canceled my plans
"So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
"Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Instead of sleeping
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
And your shoulders brush
Clowns to the West
""
Is it enough?
""
"And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away"
""
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home
Or we're making mistakes
""
"What I was wearing, if I was rude"
Like you don't even exist
You could stay
"22 (whoa, oh)"
But I'm here in your doorway
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
"And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away"
Wishing I stayed
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Staring out the window like Im not your favorite town
"'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting"
""
"And I used to say, ""Never say never"""
Come morning light
""
Would you want me?
"Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you"
So it's gonna be forever
"They become the bars that confine you,"
""
But every night with us is like a dream
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
"Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever"""
I struck a match and blew your mind
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Of cryin' I can do for you
When you say goodbye
""
When you say you've changed
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
"So, shame on me now"
(So you were never a saint
Standing in a nice dress
"Lord, save me, my drug is my baby"
"Betty, I know where it all went wrong"
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
"Yeah, you know I did one thing right"
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
as a child with sidewalk chalk
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
With you
""
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
Don't want no other shade of blue
High above the whole scene
'Cause I cant pretend it's okay when it's not
"And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go"
"And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"
You know it used to be mad love
"Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh"
"Lost my gloves, you give me one"
"It's you and me, that's my whole world"
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
Think about the place where you first met me
I'm the one who burned us down
I think he knows
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
"Ten months sober, I must admit"
"Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"
"And all we know, is touch and go"
Beneath the sun
I don't know about you
""
So don't think it's in the past
""
"Wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha"
We're burning red
It's born from just one single glance
We can't make
"I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be"
Flashback to my mistakes
I should have slept with one eye open at night
""
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
I say casually in the car
"I hate the crowds, you know that"
And right and real
"You belong with me, you belong with me"
"(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)"
"Runnin' like water, I"
""
"Third floor on the West Side, me and you"
"And the town said ""How did a middle class divorce do it?"""
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Look what you just made me??
""
"Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress"
"If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right, no!)"
"I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)"
You hold my hand on the street
"Leave with my head hung, you are the only one"
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
I was dyin' in a getaway car
""
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"But you were still gone, gone, gone"
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)
"Oh, twenty-five years old"
And what once was ours is no one's now
"Small talk, he drives"
(Ayy)
She said I looked like an American singer
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
Sensual politics
Friends don't try to trick you
So I'm leavin' out the side door
"You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much"
Standing in a nice dress
"Yeah, we were dancing"
"If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right"
I left you in a motel bar
I walked through the door with you
And I never (never) saw you coming
All this time
Like daylight
And you love the game
"Time, mystical time"
Just not home
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
Rose garden filled with thorns
"Ooh, look what you made me do"
Suddenly this summer it's clear
"King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa"
American stories burning before me
"And ah, take me out, and take me home"
"You can tell me when it's over, mm"
And by morning
""
"You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)"
But you dream of some epiphany
Something happens when everybody finds out
"Babes, don't threaten me with a good time"
""
"Ooh, look what you made me do"
My only one
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
"(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)"
I did one thing right
You were my town
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
"'Cause baby, I could build a castle"
Sent me a clear message
"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago"
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Think about the place where you first met me
"They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"""
Would everything be different today?
"You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?"
"And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world"
I'm New York City
If it could've been me
And I never (never) saw you coming
You didn't even hear me out (you didn't even hear me out)
"No apologies, he'll never see you cry"
Currents swept you out again
But if I just showed up at your party
But you would still miss me in your bones
On a balcony in summer air
(Stay!) Hey
"When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe"
And they called off the circus
""
"I get drunk, but it's not enough"
""
"So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
If I could dance with you again
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
Ooh
""
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
"Body and soul, ooh whoa"
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
Wishing I stayed
Say you'll remember me
I just wanna know you better
(And here's to my baby)
Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar
""
Ending so suddenly
"I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)"
""
You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
"Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"
"Our songs, our films, united we stand"
"When you said you needed ""space"" (what?)"
How many days did I spend thinking
Even when I break your heart
And isn't it just so pretty to think
"This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh"
And you're tossing out blame
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
"Salute to me, I'm your American queen"
Had me in the palm of your hand
""
Pack your dolls and a sweater
You weren't mine to lose
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
"And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone"
I wanna be your first string
"When youre led by blind faith, blind faith"
My only one

I felt your arms twistin' around me
And I couldn't get away from ya
You made her like that
If the high was worth the pain
Go there every??night
""
Your back
"Any promises now, can we, babe?"
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
At you for making me feel this way
Threw your victory flag away
But there's robbers to the east
You're the only one of you
But not like this
"Oh, red"
The worst thing that I ever did
"And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"
There is an indentation in the shape of you
""
I don't want you like a best friend
"Like daylight, like daylight"
"Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah"
"I've been the archer, I've been the prey"
"I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky"
I whisper in the dark
Is it cool that I said all that?
"All my days, I'll know your face"
Just one single glimpse of relief
"School bell rings, walk me home"
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
'Cause it lives in me
"I say I don't want that, but what if I do?"
And all at once
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
"Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been"
"You say you're fine, I know you better than that"
Voted most likely to run away with you
"Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til theres no us"
"Baby, all at once, this is enough"
Doing your dirtiest work for you
"'Til you put me down, oh"
I fell to my knees
You like giving them what they want...
"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way"
"I, I, I, I (I, I, I, I)"
Sit with you in the trenches
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
I want your midnights
I got some big enemies
Looking at it now
"And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"
"If you live like that, you live with ghosts"
"Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud"
In Wonderland
With Pennsylvania under me
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
I wanna be your first string (First string)
You're gorgeous
Chain 'round my neck
I look through the windows of this love
Because you break them
"And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul"
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
"But you know there is a ""me"""
With every guitar string scar on my hand
"You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you"
"But when I get you alone, it's so simple"
Come morning light
Wanna be with you
"You made your mark on me, golden tattoo"
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?

Now that it's just too late

This ultraviolet morning light below
"It just felt so good, good"
"Gold cage, hostage to my feelings"
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue

Ooh-ah

"And talking turned to screams, oh"
"We can go driving in, on my scooter"

Have you ever thought just maybe
On the one screen in my town
And it's okay if you're mad
I just wanted you to know
"Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like"
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)
So I guess all the rumors are true
I'd give you my sunshine
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
I remember
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
August sipped away
All the jokers dressing up as kings
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
You and I
And I hate to make this all about me
As long as danger is near
"But I will never bore you, baby"
"Don't blame me, love made me crazy"
"Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess"
"And I'm like, ""I just- I mean, this is exhausting, you know?"

Was what I did to you
You know it used to be mad love
"You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me"
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
"So, so, so it goes"
Are you ready for it?
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
"Then, why'd you want to go and lock me out when I let you in?"
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
I know places
"All I know is we said, ""Hello"""
"Holdin' him for ransom, some"
(For the hope of it all)
"Don't blame me, love made me crazy"
I used to think I would meet somebody there
I wanted to leave him
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
Our coming of age has come and gone
You couldn't recognize the face of your love
Heartbreak is the national anthem
"Oh, through an avalanche? And"

Gold was the color of the leaves

"It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say"
"If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay"
"And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us"
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
"Darling, I fancy you (You)"
And I snuck in through the garden gate
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
Had to listen to all this drama
And I'm so furious
"Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby"
"You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt"
That this is me trying
"I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny"
But I can see us
Or with a nasty scar
Call it what you want to
"And when we go crashing down, we come back every time"
"Take it oh, ha, ha..."
""
If I could dance with you again (Again)
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
"We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin a boat"
"And for once, you let go"
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates
"Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean"
I was begging you please don't go and I said
"I shake it off, I shake it off"
The rest of the world was black and white
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Id be a fearless leader
"And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)"
Said goodbye in a getaway car
But every night with us is like a dream
"Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time"
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
What a shame she went mad
"Well, could've been easy"

"Oh, I remember you driving to my house"
And here's to my baby
"And when we go crashing down, we come back every time"

"'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three"
"He poisoned the well, every man for himself"
She's going off about something that you said
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

I had a marvelous time

I-Island breeze and lights down low

Too in love to think straight

He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Be that girl for a month
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
At least I did one thing right
"Hoo, hoo-ooh"
"I'm settin' off, but not without my muse"
"Won't you come on over, baby?"
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Boys only want love if it's torture
I was cryin' in a getaway car
"""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"""
'Cause you have to
Never knowing what they'll mean
"You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen"
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off"
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
The light of freedom on my face
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
"Know you better, know you better now"
"Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you"""

"Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?"
"I've been the archer, I've been the prey"
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
Don't want no other shade of blue
Don't like your tilted stage

"For you, I would cross the line"
"When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said"
"Yeah, yeah, red"
"In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh"
Would it be enough
Pretend he doesn't know
"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
not just the idea of something.
Crossing out the good years
"(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)"
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

Look what you made me do
"No proof, one touch, but you felt enough"
Ridin' in a getaway car
"I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost"
Even if it's a false god
"Oh, oh-oh"
"Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah"
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? (Out of the woods)
""
All this time
Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.
"And that's what they don't know, mm, mm"
"Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you"
We might just get away with it
I forgot that you existed
'Cause you have to

"And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake"
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
Make confessions and were begging for forgiveness
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Think about the place where you first met me
"Handsome, you're a mansion with a view"
Lost in the memory
Don't call me kid
Is it cool that I said all that?
You don't know about me
"But I, I was high in the sky"
They'll tell you I'm insane
I remember when we broke up the first time
Think I know where you belong

All you had to do was (stay!)

"You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to"
All my flowers grew back as thorns
They say I did something bad
"I said, ""I've been there too a few times"""
"I, I, I, I"
"Oh, it's new, the shape of your body"
"I would be complex, I would be cool"
"And now the storm is coming, but"
And so I became the butt of the joke
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
"Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah"
And it would've been sweet
You're the West Village
They say home is where the heart is
(Oh)
"'Cause baby, I could build a castle"
Will you call when you're back at school?
""
"And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name"
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
"Baby, let the games begin"
(Out of style)
And wear you like a necklace
"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
They got no idea about me and you
"""Whatever you say, it is not right."""
You know it used to be mad love
But what can I say?
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da

'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head

"In my defense, I have none"

You must like me for me??
Like a bottle of wine
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars

Like a vendetta-ta
It's a cruel summer
Or it's gonna go down in flames
"Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh"
And I never saw you coming
"Baby, kiss it better, right"
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
So here's the truth from my red lips
"And we pretended it could last forever (ey, ey)"
"This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)"
And here's to you

"Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean"
Loves me like I'm brand new

"Why's it feel so good, good?"
"You still do it for me, babe"
"Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean"
"Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price"
The rumors are terrible and cruel
It's a cruel summer
And some things you just can't speak about
Getting back together

(Hey!)
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression

And I snuck in through the garden gate
But I don't know what to say
Are you ready for it?
"You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same"
"Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!"

""
"Come here, dressed in black now"
"Oh, oh-oh (yeah)"
"Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true"
(Things will never be the same)
Tonight
Look what you made me do

"Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy"
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)

Wanna be with you
"But, honestly, baby, who's counting?"
Just think of the fun things we could do
"I shake it off, I shake it off"
So peaceful and quiet
"I want you, bless my"
"And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)"
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And open up the door for you
Of cryin' I can do for you
Look at how my tears ricochet
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
"You promise people the world,"
And so I took an axe to a mended fence
"(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself"
"Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny"

But you got a friend in me
"You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)"
We are alone with our changing minds
I think he knows

We sing it proudly
Nobody's heard from me for months
Met you in a bar
22 (I don't know about you)
"Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah"
Shining just for you
Cursing my name
You're still all over me
My eclipsed sun
"And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right"
For breakfast at midnight
Leavin' like a father
Love you to the moon and to Saturn
"And I could go on and on, on and on"

"You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you"
And I knew you'd come back to me
Echoes she heard even in her sleep:

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off"
Forever and ever
We'll take this way too far
"And you can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me"""
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
'Cause we break down a little
"I, I, I, I"
It's a cruel summer
"Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you"
(Things will never be the same)
"And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows"
Could've followed my fears all the way down
I'm a mirrorball
You know I didn't want to
All you had to do was (stay!)
I'm lightning on my feet

In the middle of the night
"'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream"
I don't know anything but I know I miss you
There will be no further explanation.
"Know you better, know you better now"
You and I got lost in it
But I would die for you in secret
You made her like that
Look what you just made me do
Just thinking of you when she pulled up
"I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings"
Are you ready for it?
I remember
So many signs
"'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"
""
I've come too far to watch some name-dropping sleaze
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
"Ooh, look what you made me do"
"We are never, ever, ever getting back together"

Think about the place where you first met me
""
""
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
"Oh, you're the one I want"
We were lying on your couch
"With you, I fall down"
"Soon, you'll get better"
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
Is this small town
Got a long list of ex-lovers
"Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"
"My one and only, my lifeline"
"Oh, I'd..."
And I don't think we can solve 'em
Not like this
"I get so high, oh!"
Walk me back to that apartment
"I get so high, oh!"
"No, it's not"
"Nice things, honey"
(Now I'm wide awake)
"It'll leave you breathless, hmm"
"Been saying ""Yes"" instead of ""No"""
"And he's long gone, when he's next to me"
It would've been you
And I say to you...
Ooh-ah

For never leaving well enough alone
"But would you run away with me?"""
Of your fears and your ghosts
Who could stay?
And you know damn well
"But ooh, whoa oh"
"And every day is like a battle, oh-oh"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
Before I learned civility
Bathed in her brokenness
The air was cold
And it's hard to be at a party
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

And all at once
"'Cause baby, I know what you know"
And isn't it just so pretty to think
Call it what you want to

It feels like one of those nights
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"

"Shakin', pacin', I just need you"
But now I'm bleedin'

"Sun sinks down, no curfew"
Your sleight of hand
"These hands had to let it go free, and"
It's like I couldn't breathe
I love you and that's all I really know
Is it cool that I said all that?
Look what you just made me do
Wed still worship this love
Most fun I ever had

To the other si-i-i-i-ide
"Your name on my lips, tongue-tied"
Think I know it's with me
"'Til all of my sunshine was??gone, gone, gone"
I just wanna know you better

"They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House"""
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
"But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together"
"Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)"
How you laugh when you lie

And trouble's gonna follow where I go
I forgot that you
"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles"
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
Stood on the cliffside

I remember tears streaming down your face
"(Oh, oh)"
"Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws"
"Oh, oh, oh"
I've been picking up the pieces
Call it what you want?? to
Hell is when I fight with you

"I want you, bless my"
Getting caught up in a moment

And then canceled my plans
We'd still worship

"I need to say, hey, its all me, just don't go"
Back against the wall
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
But you were everything to me
Can I go where you go?
"""You don't need to save me"
"(Call it what you want, call it)"
"We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew"
They say she was seen on occasion
Our love lasts so long
"You need to calm down, you're being too loud"

And I will hold on to you
"When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away"

Let the games begin

It all seems so simple
"'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play"

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Photo album on the counter
"""I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now"
"You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?"
"And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for"
"Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want"
You'll get better soon
"But you know there is a ""me"""
"Never better (ey, ey)"
And I'll write your name
"And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor"
I'd be the man (Yeah)
"And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I"
You are in love
"Darling, this was just as hard"
But darlin'
"All the king's horses, all the king's men"
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off"
You look like bad news
Please leave me stranded
And by morning
"Nice to meet you, where you been?"
"And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down"
What did you think I'd say to that?
Because you break them

What a shame she went mad
"Soon, you'll get better"
Then why's it feel so good?
"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset"
"And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear"
Is it cool that I said all that?
"And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows"
"You are in love, true love"
"Cause baby, now we've got bad blood"
Help me hold on to you
Say my name and everything just stops...
"Darling, I'm scared (Ah)"
The less I know
No one can hurt you now
"The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me"
"Hey, big reputation, big reputation"
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
"Baby, I couldn't breathe"

At least I'm trying
"And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow"
But we were making it count
I'd be the man
"When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe"
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Trying to know somebody you never met
"She said ""James, get in, let's drive"""
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
"This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you."
Flew me to places I'd never been
"Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing"
Had me in the palm of your hand
"Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"""

"Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though"
"All I do is try, try, try"
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
Mosaic broken hearts
"I want you, bless my soul"
"Like any true love, it drives you crazy"
"Girl, there ain't no I in ""team"""
Clear blue water
"Feels like home, stay in bed"
"I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"""
I'd be the man (Oh)
"And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)"
"And say ""Meet me behind the mall"""
You're gorgeous
When all those shadows almost killed your light
"Combat, I'm ready for combat"
'Cause loving him was red
Look what you just made me do
"(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)"
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
"Now, you say you want it back"
And you love the game
From whispers on the street
I'm the one who makes you laugh
"'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello"""
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
"Faster than the wind, passionate as sin"
If you would've been the one (ooh)
I can't say anything to your face
"This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you"
"So, shame on me now"
Like your friends were the night that we first met
"Yeah, I showed up at your party"
""
I don't want you like a best friend
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
And no amount of friends at 25
But I'm still trying to find it
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore
""
We gather here
Drivin' the getaway car
'Cause I know that it's delicate
But who am I supposed to talk to?
"King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa"
I get more crazy
Or with a nasty scar
""
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
But I can see us
I'm in a getaway car
We sing it proudly
Remember how Id fly to you?
You made a really deep cut
We were crazy to think
You belong with me
""
"I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted"
"Doc, I think she's crashin' out"
Because you break them
Balancin' on breaking branches
""
You can't see it in my face
Still worship this love
Only twenty minutes to sleep
"He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand"
You are in love
"I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined"
Your faithless love's the only hoax
""
"Darling, everything's on fire"
"Yeah, we were dancing"
Were there clues I didn't see?
Grab your passport and my hand
"To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh"
I've never been a natural
You heard the rumors from Inez
"""She's a bad, bad girl"""
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
Halo hiding my obsession
And I make it look oh-so-easy
""
Wed still worship this love
I can see the end as it begins
All I know is a simple name
""
""
Ruining everything
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
"I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings"
'Cause I haven't moved in years
But we were dancing
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
"But then you called, showed your hand"
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
""
(And I can still see it all)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I can't see with anyone else
"When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?"
""
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
The master of spin
"There I was, giving you a second chance"
We were in the backseat
I just wanna know you better
"My team is losing, battered and bruising"
And just like a folk song
You were drivin' the getaway car
In the weeds
"Second, third, and hundredth chances"
""
Even though we boarded them up
"With you, I fall down (down)"
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
And I remember thinking
"""Oh my God, who is she?"""
""
"I don't belong, and my beloved, neither do you"
Even on my worst day
This is how the world works
You're so gorgeous
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
"""Your pain is manipulative."""
""
"But ooh, whoa oh"
My smoking gun
I still got love for you
"In the middle of the night, in my dreams"
"Baby, that's the fun of me"
""
"I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be"
"Ooh, look what you made me do"
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
Unless you play it good and right
Like the other girls do
"Windows flung right open, autumn air"
"I never trust a narcissist, but they love me"
""
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
So it goes??
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)
"And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"
"Of ""Are you sure?"""
"You're drowning, you're drowning"
But who could stay?
""
"Oh, your sweet disposition"
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
"But Darling, now you have to."
"Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?"
"Body and soul, ooh whoa"
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
"(I see right through me, I see right through me)"
