"Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes"
"When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness"
"Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck"
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
"was a love that was really something,"
not just the idea of something.

She heard the echoes of new words

Here's something I've learned about people.
"We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip."
"This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you."
"The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'."
"When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?"
"Let me say it again, louder for those in the back..."
"We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us."
There will be no further explanation.
There will be just reputation.

"You bite your nails,"
And laugh when you're nervous.
"You promise people the world,"
because that's what they want from you.
You like giving them what they want...
"But darling, you need to stop,"
"If you're anything like me,"
You knock on wood every time you make plans.
"You cross your fingers, hold your breath,"
Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes
Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.
"Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado..."
"If life gets too good now,"
"Darling, it scares you."
"If you're anything like me,"
"You never wanted to lock your door,"
Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer
Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore
For fear she was much better before...
"But Darling, now you have to."
"If you're anything like me,"
There's a justice system in your head
"For names you'll never speak again,"
And you make your ruthless rulings.
Each new enemy turns to steel
"They become the bars that confine you,"
In your own little golden prison cell...
"But Darling, there is where you meet yourself."
If you're anything like me
You've grown to hate your pride
To love your thighs
And no amount of friends at 25
Will fill the empty seats
At the lunch tables of your past
The teams that picked you last...
"But Darling, you keep trying."
"If you're anything like me,"
You couldn't recognize the face of your love
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
Threw your victory flag away
And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...
"Darling, later on you will thank your stars"
for that frightful day.
"If you're anything like me,"
I'm sorry.
"But Darling, it's going to be okay."
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
"And all we know, is touch and go"
We are alone with our changing minds
"We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time"
""
And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same
""
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
"Now all we know, is dont let go"
"We are alone, just you and me"
Up in your room and our slates are clean
"Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes"
""
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
""
And I never (never) saw you coming
And Ill never (never) be the same
""
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
Youre my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real
""
And I never (never) saw you coming
And Ill never (never) be the same

And I never (never) saw you coming
And Ill never

""
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
"Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow"
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said
""
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
"It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore"
"The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me"
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
""
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
"Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer"
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"

"Like any great love, it keeps you guessing"
"Like any real love, it's ever-changing"

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
"Faster than the wind, passionate as sin"
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
"Like the colors in autumn, so bright"
Just before they lose it all
""
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
"Missing him was dark grey, all alone"
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
""
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong
""
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
"Missing him was dark grey, all alone"
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
"Oh, red"
Burning red
""
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
"Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go"
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red
""
"Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known"
"Missing him was dark grey, all alone"
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
"Yeah, yeah, red"
We're burning red
""
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
"Comes back to me, burning red"
"Yeah, yeah"
""
His love was like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
0
Salt air
And the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers
"Of ""Are you sure?"""
"""Never have I ever before"""
But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Your back
Beneath the sun
Wishing I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinking I had you
But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
"For me, it was enough"
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
"And say ""Meet me behind the mall"""
"So much for summer love, and saying ""Us"""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose
No
But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
"'Cause you were never mine, mine"
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
Do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up
"And said ""Get in the car"""
And then canceled my plans
Just in case you'd call
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
"""Meet me behind the mall"""
Remember when I pulled up
"And said ""Get in the car"""
And then canceled my plans
Just in case you'd call
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
"Betty, I won't make assumptions"
About why you switched your homeroom
But I think it's 'cause of me
"Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard"
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
"Most times, but this time it was true"
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything but I know I miss you
"Betty, I know where it all went wrong"
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
"I hate the crowds, you know that"
"Plus, I saw you dance with him"
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
"Most times, but this time it was true"
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything but I know I miss you
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up
Like a figment of my worst intentions
"She said ""James, get in, let's drive"""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her but
I dreamt of you all summer long
"Betty, I'm here on your doorstep"
And I planned it out for weeks now but
It's finally sinking in
"Betty, right now is the last time"
I can dream about what happens when you see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
"So, I showed up at your party"
"Yeah, I showed up at your party"
"Yeah, I showed up at your party"
Will you have me?
Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me
Will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissing in my car again
"Stopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you"
"Vintage tee, brand new phone"
High heels on cobblestones
"When you are young, they assume you know nothing"
"Sequin smile, black lipstick"
Sensual politics
"When you are young, they assume you know nothing"
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight
"I, I knew you"
Hand under my sweatshirt
"Baby, kiss it better, right"
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
"Chase two girls, lose the one"
"When you are young, they assume you know nothing"
But I knew you
Playin' hide-and-seek and
Givin' me your weekends
"I, I knew you"
Your heartbeat on the High Line
"Once in twenty lifetimes, I"
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain
"I, I knew you"
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy
"I, I knew you"
Leavin' like a father
"Runnin' like water, I"
"And when you are young, they assume you know nothing"
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
Keep your helmet
"Keep your life, son"
Just a flesh wound
Here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
"Sir, I think he's bleedin' out"
And some things you just can't speak about
"With you, I serve"
"With you, I fall down"
Down
Watch you breathin'
Watch you breathin' out
Out
Something med school
Did not cover
Someone's daughter
Someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
"Doc, I think she's crashin' out"
And some things you just can't speak about
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen
"With you, I serve"
"With you, I fall down"
Down (down)
Watch you breathin'
Watch you breathin' out
Out
"With you, I serve"
"With you, I fall down (down)"
Down (down)
Watch you breathin'
Watch you breathin' out (out)
Out
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen
"I can see you standin', honey"
With his arms around your body
Laughin' but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defendin' now?
You were my town
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
"Hoo, hoo-ooh"
"Hoo, hoo-ooh"
"Hoo, hoo-ooh"
"I can see you starin', honey"
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
"Second, third, and hundredth chances"
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door
So step right out
There is no amount
Of cryin' I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (you didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (you never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs
So many signs (you didn't even see the signs)
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door
So step right out
There is no amount
Of cryin' I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (you didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (you never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time (so many signs)
I never learned to read your mind (so many signs)
I couldn't turn things around (so many signs)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (never gave a warning sign)
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
""
This has frozen my ground
Stood on the cliffside
"Screaming, ""Give me a reason"""
Your faithless love's the only hoax
I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do
""
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire
""
Stood on the cliffside
"Screaming ""Give me a reason"""
Your faithless love's the only hoax
I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do
""
You know I left a part of me back in New York
"You knew the hero died, so what's the movie for"
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
"You knew the password, so I let you in the door"
"You knew you won, so what's the point of keeping score?"
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
"Darling, this was just as hard"
As when they pulled me apart
""
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
""
Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head
Keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You'll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
"But it dies, and it dies, and it dies"
A million little times
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don't even exist
Take the words for what they are
"A dwindling, mercurial high"
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
"But they lie, and they lie, and they lie"
A billion little times
And you wanna scream
Don't call me kid
Don't call me baby
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know
I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me kid
Don't call me baby
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language
I can't speak with anyone else
And you know damn well
For you I would ruin myself
A million little times
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money
"Time, curious time"
"Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs"
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three year trip
Getting lunch down by the lakes
She said I looked like an American singer
"Time, mystical time"
"Cuttin' me open, then healin' me fine"
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
"Chains around my demons, wool to brave the seasons"
One single thread of gold tied me to you
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
"Time, wondrous time"
Gave me the blues and then purple pink skies
"And it's cool, baby, with me"
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh
Hee
Ooh
What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
"Or does she mouth, ""Fuck you forever""?"
Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry
I get more angry
And there's nothin' like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothin' like a mad woman
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
"They say, ""Move on"", but you know, I won't"
"And women like hunting witches, too"
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together
Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry
I get more angry
And there's nothin' like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothin' like a mad woman
I'm takin' my time
Takin' my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watchin' you climb
Watchin' you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin
Has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad
Should be scathing like me
But no one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break it's in a million pieces
Hush
"When no one is around, my dear"
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
"Spinning in my highest heels, love"
Shining just for you
Hush
I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
"Spinning in my highest heels, love"
Shining just for you
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
Hush
"When no one is around, my dear"
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
"Spinning in my highest heels, love"
Shining just for you
Hush
I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
"Spinning in my highest heels, love"
Shining just for you
And they called off the circus
Burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses
And the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
I'm still a believer but I don't know why
I've never been a natural
"All I do is try, try, try"
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything
To keep you looking at me
Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself
Tonight
We gather here
We line up weeping in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire
"You'll be made of ashes, too"
Even on my worst day
"Did I deserve, babe"
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you
I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around saving face
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
We gather stones
Never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw
Some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to
Have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels
That I gave you
As you bury me
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
"'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave"
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want
Just not home
"And you can aim for my heart, go for blood"
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you
When I'm screaming at the sky
And when you can't sleep at night
You hear my stolen lullabies
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
"You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same"
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame
Drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
Our coming of age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
"And it's just around the corner, darlin'"
'Cause it lives in me
"No, I could never give you peace"
""
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details
But you got a friend in me
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace?
""
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends
It's like I'm wastin' your honor
""
And you know that I'd
Swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
"Give you my wild, give you a child"
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east
Clowns to the West
I'd give you my sunshine
Give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come
If you're standing with me
""
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details
But you got a friend in me
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace?
Please picture me
In the trees
I hit my peak at seven feet
In the swing
Over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
"But I, I was high in the sky"
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?
Sweet tea in the summer
"Cross your heart, won't tell no other"
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with
Me and we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
Please picture me
In the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
"I, I"
Sweet tea in the summer
"Cross my heart, won't tell no other"
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long
"I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit"
"Been saying ""Yes"" instead of ""No"""
"I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though"
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinee
You know the greatest films of all time were never made
"I guess you never know, never know"
"And if you wanted me, you really should've showed"
"And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow"
And it's alright now
"But we were something, don't you think so?"
"Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool"
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
"In my defense, I have none"
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one (ooh)
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home
"We never painted by the numbers, baby"
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
"I guess you never know, never know"
"And it's another day, waking up alone"
"But we were something, don't you think so?"
"Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool"
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
"In my defense, I have none"
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
"Hey, yeah-yeah"
Persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?
"We were something, don't you think so?"
Ros flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
"In my defense, I have none"
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one (ooh)
Is it romantic how all my elegies
Eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cellphones
"Take me to the lakes, where all the poets went to die"
"I don't belong, and my beloved, neither do you"
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
"I'm settin' off, but not without my muse"
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some name-dropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth
"Take me to the lakes, where all the poets went to die"
"I don't belong, and my beloved, neither do you"
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
"I'm settin' off, but not without my muse"
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow
Right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools with my calamitous love
And insurmountable grief
"Take me to the lakes, where all the poets went to die"
"I don't belong, and my beloved, neither do you"
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
"I'm settin' off, but not without my muse"
"No, not without you"
"Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny"
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
"Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name, and money"
"And the town said ""How did a middle class divorce do it?"""
"The wedding was charming, if a little gauche"
There's only so far new money goes
"They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House"""
"Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud"
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
"And they said ""There goes the last great American dynasty"""
"Who knows, if she never showed up what could've been"
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all the Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dal
"And they said ""There goes the last great American dynasty"""
"Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been"
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness
"Their men and bad habits, and then it was bought by me"
"Who knows, if I never showed up what could've been"
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
I had a marvelous time
Ruining everything
A marvelous time
Ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time
I've been having a hard time adjusting
"I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting"
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
"I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere"
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pourin' out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
At least I'm trying
And it's hard to be at a party
When I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days
When all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel
On the one screen in my town
And I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying (maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
At least I'm trying
