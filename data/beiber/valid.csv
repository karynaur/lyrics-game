And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
So we got closer
We gotta learn to trust
"Life was so unpredictable, yeah"
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
"With you, shawty with you"
"Oh, where are you now?"
For that long journey ahead
"""I love you, need you, need you here to stay"""
Blink of an eye
"Oh, for you I would have done whatever"
Together
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea
"But you can't fly unless you listen,  let yourself fall"
""
"Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me"
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
"With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop"
I try to maintain
Say never
But I feel like that's gonna change
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
"She said it's her first time (oh, yeah, yeah)"
"Sometimes the sun shines, baby"
Wish I had the key to your heart
"Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me"
"With you, under the mistletoe (under the mistletoe)"
"Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply"
Yeah I know that I let you down
Life is worth living again
She's got everything I need
You ain't gotta rush
"Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident"
All I want is love and romance
""
"Up the stairs, to my bedroom"
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
""
For all the pain
You ain't gotta be my lover
"I could pick it up, we could take it slow"
"Oh, my heart's a vacant house"
""
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Don't want us to lose what we are
"Oh, I was starstruck"
I think she might have lied
"I only want to hear your voice, yeah"
And it led me to a miracle
When I ain't never met you at all
""
"Roller coaster, roller coaster"
"Are we an item? Girl, quit playing"
When I know you probably think it's a lie
"Oh no no, oh no no, oh no no (yeah)"
"Cause I'm right right here, yeah yeah"
""
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
"Flatline, flatline"
Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
"For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down"
"Hold on tight, that hold on tight"
""
"Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah"
Got me tossing turning in the bed
"Hey, what's the situation? Woah"
Icy for every occasion
"Ain't that serious, no"
I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
""
"We took off in that UFO, like what's hatnin' (what's hatnin')"
As long as you love me
They dont wanna see us together now
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Haunts me at night
"I stand back and point at you, you, you"
So get used to me checking in
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
"Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident"
"So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl"
Im from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
Whenever you knock me down
Oh company
"PYD, PYD, PYD"
"Maybe we, can be"
""
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't mind
"(Uh) Na na na, (Yeah) na na na, (Uh) na na na, yeah girl"
Hate our love was in vein
"I think it's time, think it's time that you show it"
You're the only girl I see
""
""
Never say never and never say never (never say it)
If I would have known
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Real deep pockets like a doctor's coat (IGH! IGH!)
"In love, in love, in love (yeah, yeah, yeah)"
I will not stay on the ground
"She got a body like that, I ain't never seen nothing like that"
"Tell me what your name is, for your information"
If I would have known
"She's got my attention, she's confident"
Look at all the children we can change
"Ooh, it feels so right"
"Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love (my love)"
"I'm right here, I'm right here, I'm right here, I'm right here, yeah"
When they don't even know that I'm hurting
"I'mma tell you one time (girl, I love, girl, I love you)"
Stay in my backpack forever
"Nothing to give our king (Bieber, what up?), pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum"
""
I'd like to give you what you need
""
Mark my words
""
"You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't"
Deep as the ocean
"Wishing I could just wash away, away"
I'ma put ya down
Cause she wanted all my attention
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
"Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me"
Our love is here to stay
"I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul"
And baby I'll be movin' on
'Less you're watching it go down with me
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
"I'mma tell you one time (girl, I love, girl, I love you)"
"Holdin' back, holdin' back"
"She said it's her first time (oh, yeah, yeah)"
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
"I knock on the door, she know who it is"
"Then we can be in love, somehow"
Running in the same place
""
""
"Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay"
""
There is also a pretty white hot spotlight
On the regular
I'd like to give you what you need
"I could take you home, yeah yeah yeah"
"Oh get used to it, eh"
Be a visionary for a change
"Yeah, never ever ever ever ever"
"You wanna make a point, but you keep preaching"
"But that is the past now, we didn't last now"
You ain't gotta make your mind up now
"Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla"
"With you, shawty with you"
But I cant stop staring at your face
"Said you're running outta time, what do you mean?"
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
"Oh she's crazy, crazy in love"
""
Oh company
They dont ever lie
"Explosive, explosive"
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
"Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you"
Arguin' won't fix the problem
"Yea, yea, yea"
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
"My little lady, yeah"
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
"All around the world, they're no different than us"
"People come and go, baby, they dont know"
Don't question it
""
"Oh, even in the midst of doubt"
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
"When your heart beats, I can hear it"
I wanna love you all over the place
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
"Man I got her screamin' ""Finally Famous!"" when we fly around"
So girl
"I could take you out, I could take you home"
"I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall"
"PYD, PYD, PYD (down)"
""
"When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go"
"I hit twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic"
I know that you want me too
That I've ever known
"I'm gonna put ya down (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)"
And never say never
But I cant stop staring at your face
I promise I'll just stay right here
Wanted to be
"I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, and  I'll be your gold"
I'd like to give you what you need
"Would you lie to me, baby?"
What do you mean?
"What's hatnin', what's hatnin'"
Who's gonna be the one to fight for it?
