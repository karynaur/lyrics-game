Felt like I couldn't breathe
I promise you there will come a day
"It's come to an end, I hate how its been"
"So, Karen don't be sad"
"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh"
""
I feel like I must've known you in another life
"There you go again, talking cinematic"
"I can't breathe without you, without you as mine"
And Pablow the blowfish
"Once upon a time, it was paradise"
The people calling me obscene
""
When you say you love me
"I can go toe-to-toe, like I'm Ali"
"I love my pussy, that means I got cattitude"
"Fade to black, show the names, play that happy song"
No matter what you say
Bust my pussy nut while I'm fingering your butt
""
I came in like a wrecking ball
Telling me maybe he could be the one
You love me the most
I need to stop sleeping on myself
"Yeah, yeah"
'Cause I made your house my home
"Sometimes now, when I do drugs I'll start to overthink, and I start crying"
"So, back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh"
"If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy"
""
I can never fall asleep
"You never been on land, and you never seen the sky"
I'm not who I used to be
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow
We have each other
"Move on, we're not seventeen"
This cat is in heat
If you couldnt rely on me
""
"Hello, goodbye"
Moving on up and forward onto all that will become
We can kiss who we want
So you roll up your sleeves and you sweat and breathe
"Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum-pum"
And how do birds fly?
""
I can't stand to see us there
"But when the lights go down, its the ending of the show"
And if I mess it up sometimes
""
Everything I've imagined
You're sweeter than candy and better than any childhood dreams
""
"Why don't you stand, stand by me?"
"Like you, like me"
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
"Turn up your gratitude, turn down your attitude"
""
Don't let them make the rules
"You might think I'm crazy (Crazy, yeah)"
And you don't deserve
""
Just fake it for a while
I'd give up all I have in exchange for who I love more than anything
""
But I don't give a fuck
Pablow the blowfish
"I start feeling mad, but then I feel inspired"
""
""
They say good things come to those who wait
Came into this world by myself
Na-na-na-na
"That's when I, I"
Sitting here with nothing to say
But I don't give a fuck (Do it)
"You, you might as well just tell the honest truth"
""
"Oh, my darlin', stand by me"
I just wanna scream
"Ooh, ooh, ooh"
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
"(I know, I know) Yeah"
Its like countin' in light years
What the fuck is gone?
Is better off than here with me
"Oh, wouldn't it be nice (so nice) to live in paradise"
""
"In the end, we'd be laughing"
"But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene"
To make somebody stay
"I know you're home, hoping I'm alright"
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
"Forget the haters, 'cause somebody loves ya"
Holding onto tomorrow (Wherever I go)
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
"(Woo, woo!) Yeah"
'Cause I surely can't help you
"I'm nasty, I'm evil"
"Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?"
Mike Will Made-It
Red cup get messed up boi
"I get scared, I feel ignored"
""
I'm here balancin' too many things
I'm so thankful for the moments
"Yeah, shes not him"
"Love, money, party"
"I'll find a way, yeah"
"On the earth, or up in the stars"
Now that you and me are one
Everybody makes mistakes
"And it seems you just wanna bring me down, down"
Fuck yeah
"Oh, sun, I see you happy"
"Hell they could tell, she don't even budge"
"And why, why can't I love you, baby?"
Thinking about driving around in your car
""
"Oh, space dude in your space boots and your space suit"
""
"You can change your mind, thats just the way it goes"
"You're right, we're grown now"
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
"No, I'm not breaking"
"I aint take no shots, but you still got me hot"
"He could be the one, he could be the one"
He talks about you in his sleep
"After we drank all night, and we done a bunch of pills"
"Yeah, I'm digging it"
""
""
High not low and away we go
Sometimes you're gonna have to lose
For better or for worse
So much for taking this too far
""
When the waves
"Wake up, and do it on my own"
I wanna be with the one I know
""
"He's got something special, he's got something special"
"Love, money, party, yeah"
That part's up to you
"Love, money, party"
'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye
"Ooh, yeah"
