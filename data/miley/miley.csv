"I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you

We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu"
"We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me"

"I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Whoa)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.ÿ
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.ÿ

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

"Oh, you broke my heart
I told you I was weak for love
But then you went around
And did what you wanted to do
And now I'm cryin', cryin'

Ooh, it seemed like everything was going fine
I found the love that I thought was gonna last
But then I accidentally saw a few things in your cell
I even LOL'd
Man, I should've known
Why? Why you're doing what you do?
You, you might as well just tell the honest truth
See, I'm not really down with this
This ain't no texting shit
No, I ain't got no biz, but it is what it is

I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's ""F"" and the other one's ""U""
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them's ""F"" and the other one's ""U""

I'm pressing ""send"" on you

Could've been this, could've been that
We done been there, we done been back
You ain't with it, could've said that
Why you tripping?
Let me hit that
I ain't trying to argue no more
I do it all for you
You know you're my ride or die, baby, let me show you

Oh, I know what's been goin' on
Don't even try to act like Mr. Super Nonchalant
What makes you think I'll stick around?
I'm not as stupid as you sound
And you sound really dumb right now
From A to Zed, ooh-ah
I got a lot of nasty things floating up in my head
But none of them are worth my time
You're not even worth this rhyme
And I don't, I don't give a flying

I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's ""F"" and the other one's ""U""

Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them's ""F"" and the other one's ""U""

What you trippin' on?
Girl, you know you wrong
Don't let these girls drive you crazy, haan

I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you

"I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
""You'll never reach it""
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost, with no direction
My faith is shaken

But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Aint about how fast I get there
Aint about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going

And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, 'cause...

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Aint about how fast I get there
Aint about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb


There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes you're gonna have to lose
Aint about how fast I get there
Aint about what's waiting on the other side

Keep on moving
Keep climbing
Keep the faith, baby
It's all about, it's all about the climb
Keep your faith, keep your faith

"You're in my bed uninvited
It's fine 'cause I'm in the mood
Hope you don't mind if I spike it
We'll drink it, just me and you

And you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be sleeping on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started

Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
Hit the Goose, raise a toast, pop the molly
I can go toe-to-toe, like I'm Ali
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me

Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me

These planes are all UFOs
And this city's in outer space
It's better than where we came from
I think that we both should stay

'Cause you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be fucking on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started

Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
Hit the ghost, raise a toast, pop the molly
All the girls in my room look like Dolly
We're all tryna fill the lonely

"Feels like I just woke up
Like all this time I've been asleep
Even though it's not who I am
I'm not afraid of who I used to be

No one stays the same (Oh, oh)
You know what goes up must come down (Oh, oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (Oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (oh, oh)

Feels like I've been living in a dream
But never make it to the end
My eyes open when they feel the light
It's always right before I'm about to scream

No one stays the same (Oh, oh)
You know what goes up must come down (Oh, oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (Oh, oh)

All the way in the back with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me, ""What you doing with that?""
Yeah, yeah
You say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me
One day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at

I slick, caught her eyeing down my purse
Where the dollars at?
I let her know the rent's due on the first
They can call the hearse
'Cause, if there's any violation, I go off with that
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with a big dog
(Why I need his millis when I got Billy on my speed dial?)
You know I'm on that ""meow"", quick to scratch your eyes out
Strutting on the court, make them nervous, call a timeout

"I'm writing down my dreams, all I'd like to see
Starting with the bees or else they're gonna die
There will be no trees or air for us to breathe
I start feeling mad, but then I feel inspired
Thinkin' about the days
Coming home with dirty feet from playing with my dad
All day in the creek
He somehow has a way of knowing what to say
So when I'm feeling sad, he makes me feel inspired

We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
To think we are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up the change
I know that sounds so strange
Because you always felt so small, but know you aren't at all
And I hope you feel inspired
Oh, I hope you feel inspired

How can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?
Death is life, it's not a curse
Reminds us of time and what it's worth
To make the most out of it while we're here

We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
We are meant for more
There's a lock upon the door, but we hold the key to change

But how can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?"
"Mike WiLL Made

Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning (In the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home, without your love
Without it

You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it, then what'd you say forever for?
If forever's out the door
I'll ignore when you call

Drive my heart into the night (Yeah)
You could drop the keys off in the morning (In the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it

You told me you were coming back, right back
You promised it was real, and I believed that
But if I fall for it again, I will be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you? Yeah
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses, I'll just let 'em die
I was crazy thinking you were mine
It was all just a lie

Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home (Leave home) without your love
Without it

I always knew I never wanted this
I never thought it could happen (Never thought it could happen)
You acted like you wanted this
But then you led me on (Led me on)
I thought you would be there when I go (When I go)
You promised you would be there when I go (I go)
But all broken promises, I won't miss, I'm finished
All I know are the facts
That when I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies
Been there, done that

Drive my heart into the night (Yeah, yeah)
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it"
"Alright, so this is really fucked up, but
Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him in the first place
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong that, I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to be
And you know that, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence, but you know, I haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea what the fuck I want, I guess

You're giving me a feeling in my head
Laying in my bed just thinking
Not really feeling like the one I want
Takes everything in me not to call him
I really, really, really want it, too
I told all my friends I'm moving on
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

You know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat
I mean, even in front of your mom
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your fucking friends do
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead but, you know I just, I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo

You keep saying again and again
We're laying in my bed just talking
And now I, now I can't hold it back
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit
I don't really wanna let go of you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

Alright, so, I'm gonna be honest
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here
I mean, I'm fucking what?
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send back the monkey, you know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes? That means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me
I mean, I don't wanna say it in person, I just bury my head in your armpit which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...
Well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to someone giving a fuck
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo

Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Love me so you stop baby talking
I don't really wanna let go of you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking"

Felt like this for awhile

Money ain't nothing but money

Party ain't nothing but a party
When you party every day, it ain't nothing but a party
Love, money, party

"Smooth talking
So rocking
He's got everything that a girl's wanting
Guitar cutie
He plays it groovy
And I can't keep myself from doing something stupid
Think I'm really falling for his smile
Get butterflies when he says my name

He's got something special, he's got something special
And when he's looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special, he's got something special
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me
Telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one, he could be the one

He's lightning
Sparks are flying
Everywhere I go, he's always on my mind
And I'm going crazy about him lately
And I can't help myself from how my heart is racing
Think I'm really digging on his vibe
He really blows me away (hey!)

He's got something special, he's got something special
And when he's looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special, he's got something special
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me
Telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one, he could be the one

And he's got a way of making me feel
Like everything I do is perfectly fine
The stars are aligned when I'm with him
And I'm so into him

He's got something special, he's got something special
And when he's looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special, he's got something special
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me
Telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one, he could be the one"
"You wake up
Its raining and its Monday
Looks like one of those rough days
Times up
Youre late again, so get out the door
Sometimes you feel like running
Find a whole new life and jump in
Let go, get up and hit the dance-floor

But when the lights go down, its the ending of the show
And youre feeling like you got nowhere to go
Dont you know...

You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, thats just the way it goes
You can say ""goodbye"", and you can say ""hello""
But youll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows
Youll always find your way back home

Your best friends, your little hometown
Are waiting up wherever you go now
You know that you can always turn around
'Cause this world is big and its crazy
And this girl is thinking that maybe
This life is what some people dream about

'Cause when Im feeling down and I am all alone
Ive always got a place where I can go
'Cause I know...

You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, thats just the way it goes
You can say goodbye, and you can say hello
But youll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows
Youll always find your way back home

Where they know exactly who you are
Back home, where the real you is the superstar
Back home, you know its never too far away

You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, thats just the way it goes
You can say goodbye, and you can say hello
But youll always find your way back

You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, thats just the way it goes
You can say goodbye, and you can say hello
But youll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows
Youll always find your way back home

Youll always find your way back home
Youll always find your way back home
Youll always find your way back home
Youll always find your way back home
Youll always, you'll always find your way
Youll always find your way (back home) back home"
"I wanna start by saying thank you
I'm gonna miss ya, honey
You gave me things you cant buy back with money
You changed my life
You've been my world
There's no other girl that looks like ya, darling
Those eyes, that tongue, those teeth, that face, that body
Even though weve gone to outer space
Still no way you can take his place

You're not him
Yeah, she's not him
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I just can't fall in love with you
'Cause you're not him
Yeah, she's not him

And why, why can't I love you, baby?
Like I wanna love you, baby
Im sorry
And maybe its beyond my control
Some sort of chemical reaction
Making it impossible to let him go

You're not him
Shes not him
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I just can't fall in love with you
'Cause you're not him
Yeah, shes not him

And you don't deserve
All the bullshit I've put you through
You, you deserve
A heart much bigger than one that's torn in two
Oh, oh

You're not him (Whoa)
She's not him
Every time you walk through my door
I swear to God you're more beautiful than before
But you're not him
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I just can't fall in love with you
'Cause you're not him
Yeah, she's not him"
"Everybody needs inspiration
Everybody needs a song
A beautiful melody
When the night's so long

'Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy

Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

When I look at you, I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone

Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that
Cover me, all I need
Every breath that I breathe
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
I look at you

You appear just like a dream
To me"
"How can I love someone I never touched?
You lived under the water, but I love you so much
You never been on land, and you never seen the sky
You don't know what a cloud is
Why does everything I love have to die?
They all wanted to see you be as big as you could be
But I couldn't let that be
By keeping you small, by keeping you safe
If I could do it again, I'd release you to sea
'Cause I can't bear to see something so wild just die in a tank

And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so much
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad

On Saturday night, we all went out to eat
But I can never decide, so someone chose sushi
I got soup, and I ordered rice
But watching my friends eat my friends, ruined my appetite

Oh, Pablow the blowfish
If they only knew you like I do
They'd love you too
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad

I won't forget, even one second we had
'Cause you might be gone, but you could never be dead
I heard of a seahorse named Sadie
I heard she was quite the lady
Maybe you'll find her and you could make babies
That'd be kind of crazy

If Pablow the blowfish
Found love deep in the sea
Then that would mean
Pablow the blowfish
Is better off than here with me

But Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad"
"I always knew this day would come
We'd be standing one by one
With our future in our hands
So many dreams, so many plans
I always knew after all these years
There'd be laughter, there'd be tears
But never thought that I'd walk away
With so much joy but so much pain
And it's so hard to say goodbye

But yesterday's gone, we gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments
So glad I got to know ya
The times that we had, I'll keep like a photograph
And hold you in my heart forever
I'll always remember you

Another chapter in the book
Cant go back, but you can look
And there we are on every page
Memories I'll always save
Up ahead, only open doors
Who knows what we're heading towards
I wish you love, I wish you luck
For you, the world just opens up
But it's so hard to say goodbye

Yesterday's gone, we gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments
So glad I got to know ya
The times that we had, I'll keep like a photograph
And hold you in my heart forever
I'll always remember you

Every day that we had, all the good, all the bad
I'll keep them here inside
All the times that we shared, every place, everywhere
You touched my life
Yeah, one day we'll look back, we'll smile, and we'll laugh
But right now we just cry
'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye

Yesterday's gone, we gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments
So glad I got to know ya
The times that we had, I'll keep like a photograph
And hold you in my heart forever
I'll always remember you
I'll always remember you
I'll always remember you"
"Here we are now
Everything's about to change
We face tomorrow
As we say goodbye to yesterday
A chapter ending
But the story's only just begun
A page is turning for everyone

So, Im moving on, letting go
Holding onto tomorrow
Oh, Ive always got the memories
While Im finding out who Im gonna be
We might be apart
But I hope you always know
Youll be with me
Wherever I go
Wherever I go

So excited
I can barely even catch my breath
We have each other
To lean on for the road ahead
This happy ending
Is the start of all our dreams
And I know your heart is with me

So, Im moving on, letting go
Holding onto tomorrow
Oh, Ive always got the memories
While Im finding out who Im gonna be
We might be apart
But I hope you always know
Youll be with me
Wherever I go

It's time to show the world
Weve got something to say
A song to sing out loud
Well never fade away
I know Ill miss you
But well meet again someday
Well never fade away

So, Im moving on, letting go
Holding onto tomorrow
Oh, Ive always got the memories
While Im finding out who Im gonna be
We might be apart
But I hope you always know
Youll be with me... (Wherever I go)

So, Im moving on, letting go
Holding onto tomorrow (Wherever I go)
Oh, Ive always got the memories
While Im finding out who Im gonna be
We might be apart
But I hope you always know
Youll be with me, yeah
Wherever I go

Wherever I
Wherever I go"
"They say love can drive ya crazy, my dear
I wanna trap you in a locket, or in my pocket
So I can keep you near
You know I'd never hurt you
If you fall, Id pick you up and I'd drink your tears
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

They say good things come to those who wait
Its like countin' in light years
I'd physically live without you, but I don't want to
And death's never been my fear
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

When you look up at a rainbow
Do you ever wonder what's really waiting at the end?
I don't want no gold, nothings more than you
The amount is hard to even comprehend
Nothing I can do, I lost control
Something we hold on to so dear
But how can I miss you so much when youre right here?

And how at this optimal time did you just appear?
Everyone under their guard, so full of shit
But you are just so sheer
You're my God, youre my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

When you look up at the cosmos
Do you ever wonder if there's really even an end?
It might go on forever, like my love for you
An amount that's hard to even comprehend
I wont waste my time with wonder, in apprehension, or livin' life in fear
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

You're my God, you're my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?"
"Sha
Sha
Sha

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we've shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear

The 7 things I hate about you
The 7 things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know, it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear (Clear, clear)
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking 7 steps here

The 7 things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know, it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the 7 that I like

The 7 things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you

Sha, sha
You do, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh (La, la, la)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh"
"I sleep with the door open if you want to come in while I'm sleeping
I'm always sleeping naked, 'cause you wake up and you're creeping
Want to lick it so much that it's almost like I taste it on the tip of my tongue
I want to touch it so bad that it's almost like I can feel it on my fingertips
I want yours inside of me, but don't forget where I like licking, babe
I want to make your fantasies realities I want to be your's, babe

I want you to bang my box
I want you to bang my box

There ain't nothing I'm scared to try
I can be on top, or if you like it I just lie here
Take my picture
Position my body wherever you like
Just know I like it naughty
Teach me a lesson, pretend we never met
But we can keep just kissing, 'cause you're getting me so wet
The only downside to this morning is you getting up and you leaving
When I'm dreaming and you're in 'em I wake myself up, 'cause I'm screaming
Uh-huh, what are you doing to me?
It's like you're a zookeeper setting animals free
You release me like a tiger that's been locked in a cage
Here I am, here you are
I want it so hard
You finger my heart
And I know just what I need
What I came here to do
What I've been thinking, babe, been most about you

I want you to bang my box
I want you to bang my box

You say it tastes like cake with my lips against your face
Want you to eat it, babe"
"I had a dream Davie Bowie taught us how to skateboard
But he was shaped like Gumby
And I had a dream we took a helicopter
Flew it up too high, got stuck in the clouds
Don't wanna come down
And I had a dream
We went on a safari
I said, ""Look at that lion, she reminds me of you 'cause you're the queen.""
And I had a dream that you were dying
But I wasn't even crying
I just sang you to sleep, I sang you to sleep

But what does it mean?
What does it all mean?
Oh, I had a dream
What did it mean?
What did it mean?

And I had a dream we robbed the record store
The one with the yellow door
We stole every goddamn record they had
And I had a dream that I didn't give a fuck
But I give a fuck
I miss you so bad, I think I might die

What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
I had a dream
But, what did it mean?
What did it mean?
I just wanna scream
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
I just wanna scream
I just wanna scream

What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
I had a dream
But what does it mean?
What does it mean?
I had a dream
But what does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it all mean, mean?

And I had a dream we were being chased by a monster
Or maybe they were aliens
But I wasn't scared 'cause you were there
And I had a dream we took karate
That's when you said you loved me
You loved me

What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
Fuck yeah"
"You are everything to me
And I, I would die for you
There've been times where I'm up all night
Crying in the dark, so I sleep with the light on
I've heard I've got words like a knife
That I don't know how to choose just so wisely
But I see trees and their colored leaves
When I think about all that we could be

When you're gone, time moves so slow
Like the grass, I've watched us grow
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I never let you know?

That you are everything to me
You're sweeter than candy and better than any childhood dreams
I am yours and you are mine
I have your heart, I don't even need a ring
I'd give up all I have in exchange for who I love more than anything

When you're gone, time moves so slow
Like the grass, I've watched us grow
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I ever let you know?

'Cause you, you're everything to me
And I, I would die for you
Yeah, I would die for you

When you're gone time, moves so slow (I would die)
Like the grass, I've watched us grow (I would die)
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow (I would die)
How could I never let you know?
I would die for you"
"If I spent a week without you
Bet you'd wonder what Id do
I think that I'd start goin' out
Get caught kissin other dudes
And it seems you just wanna bring me down, down
With your bad attitude (bad attitude)
When you know I'm not one to keep dealin' with the shit
That you put me through

I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
And that's what's got me wondering what it's like
To not have you around

If I spent a week without you, hmm
I'd probably have so much fun (have so much fun)
First things first I'd gather up all my girls, yeah
So we can lay out in the sun
Oh, itd be so nice not to worry, yeah
How Id love not to stress
I'd go and grab my old blue jeans
Im sick of wearing this silly dress

I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
And that's what's got me wondering what it's like
To not have you around

You know Id miss you, babe
Feels like I've known you since I was just 7 years old
You used to make me smile, but now you don't do that anymore
It feels like I'm always just crying and sleeping alone
But when I think of you gone
I know

I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
I don't want to wonder what it's like
To not have you around
To not have you around, to not have you around
To not have you around, to not have you around

You know I'd miss you, babe
You know I'd miss you, babe
You know I'd miss you, babe
(Know I'd miss you)"
"Sitting here with nothing to say
Looking out the window
It just rained, but the sun's up for the day
And there's probably a rainbow
But I don't care 'cause all the colors left with you
Thinking about driving around in your car
I never thought that we would take it very far
I just love talking, and then parking, then we'd go walking
I loved you so much
I just started watching TV
I get so high 'cause you're not here smoking my weed
And I get so bored 'cause you're not here to make me laugh
You're so cute in your space suit
In your space boots
Space dude
Since you've left, I've started to drink
Sometimes now, when I do drugs I'll start to overthink, and I start crying
I think I'm dying
But I'm just tripping
Start spiraling down this hole

Oh, space dude in your space boots
I got to be high to deal with your moods
But maybe it's me, I got to change my view
Oh, space dude in your space suit
Our love, it takes us to the moon
But you leave me up there, I'm so marooned
Oh, space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude
Space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude

Every time we talk I feel like shit
I guess I was just tryin' to avoid letting myself feel like this
'Cause it makes me feel like I might die
But every second I'm doing that anyway
My biggest fear is not being with you
The pain is so excruciating I don't know what I'd do
We're both vegan
It makes it easy to think youd never hurt anything
Living intentionally

Oh, space dude in your space boots
I got to be high to deal with your moods
But maybe it's me, I got to change my view
Oh, space dude in your space suit
Our love, it takes us to the moon
But you leave me up there, I'm so marooned
Oh, space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude
Space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude"
"You tucked me in, turned out the light
Kept me safe and sound at night
Little girls depend on things like that
Brushed my teeth and combed my hair
Had to drive me everywhere
You were always there when I looked back
You had to do it all alone
Make a living, make a home
Must have been as hard as it could been
And when I couldn't sleep at night
Scared things wouldn't turn out right
You would hold my hand and sing to me

Caterpillar in the tree
How you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far, but you can always dream
Wish you may, and wish you might
Don't you worry, hold on tight
I promise you there will come a day
Butterfly fly away

Butterfly fly away (butterfly fly away)
Got your wings, now you can't stay
Take those dreams and make them all come true
Butterfly fly away (butterfly fly away)
You've been waiting for this day
All along you've known just what to do

Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly, butterfly fly away
Butterfly fly away
Butterfly fly away"
"In your bed, or in your car
On the earth, or up in the stars
I wanna be where you are
Even if that means going too far
At your place, or up in space
You can, you can meet me out, as long as I see your face
I wanna be, where you are
Even if that means, letting go of my heart
You take me higher than Ive been before
Dont laugh when I say that, 'cause we just smoked a bowl
And I, I have a hard time, anyway, saying how I feel
But Im a little buzzed, so Im keeping it real
And I tried to take it slow, but
When you're 'round me, my pots about to blow
And everything you do just turns me on
So lets go to my room, and ""na-na""

Shit's 'bout to get real freaky, I can feel it
I hope you're ready
I'm into whatever
Shit's 'bout to get real freaky, I can feel it
Don't you worry, we won't regret it

It's never felt right to be so wrong
I should've called you sooner, you loved me for so long
And it's been a while since I've been with someone else
'Cause I got too good at just doing it myself
At your dads place, or at your moms
And if theyre both home, we can go out on the lawn
And I wanna walk around while wearing high heels
After we drank all night, and we done a bunch of pills

Before it's all about to begin

(Ooh) I wake up in a bad mood"
"Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Oh, I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your skin is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene
And you could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene"

"I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were somethin' special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

I've got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
(I can't wait)
Now I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, ""Oh, she's just being Miley""
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-woah-woah, I, I can't wait to see you again

I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm reading the sign
(That you can't wait)
That you can't wait to see me again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down

"You gotta love someone

I don't know what youve been told
Or what they say about me
I never give up, but give it a rest
I ain't got time to worry about a mess
And I'm kinda getting tired of dealing with all your stress
Im starting to think you have no heart, yeah
You don't even have a soul
You always give in or ya try too late
All I do is give and all you do is take
I'm tired of protecting you from what you need to know, come on

Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and moving on
Hey, yeah

I'm not sure where I'd even go
'Cause I made your house my home
It's come to an end, I hate how its been
Lights are getting dim and the walls are caving in
And its time for this queen to go and find another throne
When I give it up, I give it all
I went and made you my life
Don't you dare say I dont care
When I need you most, you know you're never there
It'd be a cold day in hell before I'd ever be your wife, thats right

Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and moving on

Kickin' off my shoes and runnin' towards the sun
I said ""Nothing's really worth it unless you're having fun""
To make somebody stay
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and moving on

You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone"

Sometimes I'm in a jam
I've gotta make a plan
It might be crazy
I do it anyway
No way to know for sure
I figure out a cure
I'm patching up the holes, but then it overflows

If I'm not doing too well
Why be so hard on myself?

Nobody's perfect, I gotta work it
Again and again, 'til I get it right
Nobody's perfect, you live and you learn it
And if I mess it up sometimes
Hey, nobody's perfect!

Sometimes I work a scheme, but then it flips on me
Doesn't turn out how I planned
Get stuck in quicksand
But no problem can't be solved once I get involved
I try to be delicate, then crash right into it

But my intentions are good
Sometimes just misunderstood

Nobody's perfect, I gotta work it
Again and again, 'til I get it right
Nobody's perfect, you live and you learn it
And if I mess it up sometimes
Oh, nobody's perfect, I gotta work it
I know in time I'll find a way
Nobody's perfect

Sometimes I fix things up, and they fall apart again
(Nobody's perfect)
I might mix things up, but I always get it right in the end
(You know I do)

Next time you feel like it's just one of those days
When you just can't seem to win
If things don't turn out the way you planned
Figure something else out, don't stay down, try again
Yeah!

Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody has those days
Everybody knows what, what I'm talking 'bout

The purple that is collapsing
Head for the hills and prepare your intellect to flow
The game of life is changing
Man is about to awake
Electric sun beams dancing in a liquid in my skull

The milky, milky, milk
Your tongue licking me so hard
And from sucking on your nipples
Licking milky, milky stars

I feel like a slab of butter
That is melting in the sun
The presence melts away
Now that you and me are one

I made a (va)nilla sundae and the greatest truth appear
That open up the flood tides of the last 2 billion years
I ask myself a question
What the fuck is gone?
But I knew that I knew it from the milky, milky gods

The milky, milky, milk
Your lips get me so wet

But how can I be glad now my flower is dead
Oh, sun, I see you happy
You made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth
I don't want to believe you

The night has the power
To hold all your helplessness in
Heaven
The darkness and sadness
Hold to each other 'til tomorrow

The sunrise insists on gladness
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead
Oh, sun, I see you happy
You made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth
I don't want to believe you

Death, take me with you
I don't wanna live without my flower
Tomorrow, tomorrow
The time that it takes for love to effect a person
So deep, so deep

"There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road while you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me, suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win

Are you a mouse or a bear or a..? Um
Whatever you are it's probably the cutest mouse/bear thing I've ever seen
I'm a unicorn if you can't tell
You're the cutest unicorn in the world
That's fine, we can just go to riff on it
Sorry I was fucking up, I was drifting sorry
I was flirting sorry, sorry I was flirting, sorry
Alright everybody, sorry I'll fuck off, here we go, I'm sorry here

Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win
Hey now, hey now, don't dream

"Hey, Miley
It's me, Im in Nashville
I'm on my way to Dollywood, busy as you are
Can't get enough stuff to do, cant
But anyway, I'm excited about singing with you
So I'm just gonna turn my CD player on with you singing
I'm gon' put this on a cassette
Sing along with it, and then I'll run you off a CD later
Oh, I'm so high tech
I got a flip phone too
But anyhow, see what you think
And mmm, here I go

Come on
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where everything goes as planned and I smile
Cause I know if we tried, we could really make a difference in this world
I wont give up or sleep a wink
It's the only thought I think
You know where I stand
I believe we can start livin in a rainbowland

Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I'd be lyin' (Id be lyin'), if I said this was fine
All the hurt and the hate going on here (hate going on here)
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland

Living in a rainbowland
Where skies are blue and things are grand
Oh, wouldn't it be nice (so nice) to live in paradise
Where we're free to be exactly who we are
Let's all dig down deep inside
Brush the judgment and fear aside
Make wrong things right (all things right), and end the fight
'Cause I promise ain't nobody gonna win
(C'mon)

Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I'd be lyin' (I'd be lyin'), if I said this was fine
All the hurt and the hate going on here (hate going on here)
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand together (let's do it together)
Change things forever (forever)
I know there's got to be a greater plan
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through (shine my head)
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Hey, Miley
Look, I know it sounds scrambled when I'm singing it with you
Wish I could do a little better
At least, I might not get it all the way through
'Cause I'm not sure of the structure without you
But I think this could work well, don't you?
If not, like I said
I'll write that love song for you
You probably wrote it about some boy you loved, didn't ya?
Well..."
"They say love grows, but I've only seen it die
I'm too young to feel like I'm running out of time

I get so scared
Thinking I'll never get over you
I always be making a compromise no matter what I do, ooh
And maybe I'll never get over you

I've heard no one controls what happens in our lives
The universe gets to decide
Our future is written up here in the sky

And I get so scared
Thinking I'll never get over you
Everything I've imagined
And none of our plans coming true

I met someone new, and now I'm scared to go all the way
I hear you in my mind, and can't let go of what you used to say
I'm freakin', it's repeating when you said there'll never be a day
When letting go feels like before, tonight we're trying anyway

And I get so scared
Thinking they'll all be just like you
All the ways that you hurt me
And all of the shit you put me through

But maybe they'll all be just like you
Or maybe, theyll never come close to you
So maybe, I'll never get over you
Baby"
"I ain't looking at you for no particular reason
It's just a tough spot for me to be in
I gotta open that door
Gotta get it open
I'ma push my way through, just like a robber
And smile for the camera
Damn, that felt awesome
Push it open little more
Gotta get it open

You would never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject, 'cause, 'cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up, and do it on my own

Hey
I'll find a way, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
Hey
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own

I will get it done with the help from no one
Came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else
We have just begun
So much to do, so young
Don't be afraid of alone
You'll get it done on your own

I know you're in there; open up, open up
Just like the Feds looking for the stuff
Three knocks at the door
I gotta get it open
I'm so confused with all the traffic
I'ma skip the line
Who cares what happens
I gotta stay on that course
I gotta get it open

You would never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject, 'cause, 'cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up, and do it on my own

"Don't get me wrong, I love who I am
I don't wanna be ungrateful
It probably sounds strange
I really love the role I play, the songs I sing
But with all the fame
The things that seemed so simple
Are suddenly so far out of reach
I wish that they could see that underneath

I'm just an ordinary girl
Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored
I get scared, I feel ignored
I feel happy, I get silly
I choke on my own words
I make wishes, I have dreams
And I still want to believe
Anything can happen in this world
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me

How are you?
Hello, goodbye
One day here, one day there
And again it's time to go
Miss Popular, always on the road
Put my best foot forward
Gotta get on with the show
Strike a pose for the front cover of a magazine
Everywhere I arrive, I get high-fives
They paint me larger than life (Yeah)

I'm just an ordinary girl
Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored
I get scared, I feel ignored (Yeah)
I feel happy, I get silly
I choke on my own words
I make wishes, I have dreams
And I still want to believe
Anything can happen in this world
For an ordinary girl

So give it everything or nothing at all
And get back on your feet
When you stumble and fall
A little luck can go a long way
So don't you worry about what people say
Who knows when the wind may blow
For an ordinary girl (Hmm)

I'm just an ordinary girl
Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored
I get scared, I feel ignored
I feel happy, I get silly
I choke on my own words
I make wishes, I have dreams
And I still want to believe
Anything can happen in this world
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me, yeah
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me

For an ordinary girl
Mmm, for an ordinary girl
Like me, like you"
"Something in the way you love me
Something in the way you stare
I wanna be there skateboarding
In a space dude's evil lair

Something in the way you fuck me
You're never fucking there
Something in the way you touch me
I wonder, I should care?
Okay, keep that last one

Sleeping makes us optimistic
And we can't live without dreaming
It's the only time we can really be together
But I'm optimistic
There's something giving me that feeling
There's something giving me that feeling
There's something
There's something giving me that feeling
There's something"
"Uh oh
There you go again, talking cinematic
Yeah, you
You're charming
Got everybody starstruck
I know how you always seem to go
For the obvious, instead of me
But get a ticket, and you'll see

If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughing
Watching the sunset
Fade to black, show the names, play that happy song

Yeah, yeah
When you call me, I can hear it in your voice
Oh sure
Wanna see me and tell me all about her?
La la
I'll be acting through my tears
Guess you'll never know that I should win an Oscar for this scene I'm in

If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughing
Watching the sunset
Fade to black, show the names, play that happy song

Wish I could tell you there's a twist
Some kind of hero in disguise and we're together
It's for real, now playing
Wish I could tell you there's a kiss
Like something more than in my mind
I see it could be amazing if we were a movie

If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughing
Watching the sunset
Fade to black, show the names, play that happy song
If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughing
Watching the sunset
Fade to black, show the names, play that happy song"
