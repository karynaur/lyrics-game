Every day that I'm alive, Ima ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, aint no way I'ma switch

Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and Im aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, Ill show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
Its got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

Pull up in yo trap niggas scatter like roaches
All my close friends drug dealers and vultures
I'm sippin' out a coffee cup but this ain't Folgers
I know you still mad about the brick that I sold
I cook me up a brick and went and bought me a Rollsie
I'm playin' with the rock like my real name is Hova
AK-47 still strapped to my shoulder
Them niggas tote choppers like them niggas from Magnolia
I fucked a nigga's bitch
I fucked another nigga's bitch
When you gettin' money you can fuck a nigga's bitch
VVS diamonds I done flooded out my wrist
I ain't talkin bout Toronto when I say I'm in the 6

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When you tryna get this money for a brick
Reaching in your pocket feelin' lit
Fuck that I'm running off with niggas' shit
All the codeine and gas money spent
You had bands now you ain't even got a zip
All your homeboys fuckin' on your bitch
Fuck that you better take a nigga's shit

Take a nigga's shit you better take a nigga's shit
I just took a nigga's shit and flooded out my wrist
Rappin' ass nigga you ain't really with the shit
You ain't never sold no coke and you ain't never hit a lick
You drove all the way from Macon thought he came to buy a brick
But we stripped him left him naked he had nothing but his dick
Man we pull up like the Secret Service, nothin' 'bout no sticks
Mess with 21 Savage, they gon' put you on a list

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When you tryna get this money for a brick
Reaching in your pocket feelin' lit
Fuck that I'm running off with niggas' shit
All the codeine and gas money spent
You had bands now you ain't even got a zip
All your homeboys fuckin' on your bitch
Fuck that you better take a nigga's shit"
