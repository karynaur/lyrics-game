The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
"Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox"
"And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like"
""
"Girl, you know I want your love"
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
"Come on now, follow my lead"
"I may be crazy, don't mind me"
"Say, boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
"Come on now, follow my lead"
"Come, come on now, follow my lead"
""
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh?I?oh?I?oh?I?oh?I

Oh?I?oh?I?oh?I?oh?I

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
"You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat"
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
"Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat"
"Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like"

I found a love for me
"Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead"
"Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet"
"Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me"
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
"But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own"
"And in your eyes, you're holding mine"
""
"Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms"
"Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song"

"Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know"
"She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home"
"I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets"
"To carry love, to carry children of our own"
"We are still kids, but we're so in love"
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
"Darling, just hold my hand"
"Be my girl, I'll be your man"
I see my future in your eyes

"Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms"

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
"I was younger then, take me back to when I"
""
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
"And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown"
But I can't wait to go home
""
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
"Singing to ""Tiny Dancer"""
"And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real"
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
""
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
"Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right"
"But I was younger then, take me back to when"
""
"We found weekend jobs, when we got paid"
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
"Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown"
But I can't wait to go home

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
""
"And I'm on my way, I still remember"
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
"And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real"
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
"Yeah, you look happier, you do"
""
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
"Promise that I will not take it personal, baby"
If you're moving on with someone new
""
"'Cause baby you look happier, you do"
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
""
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
"You're happier, aren't you?"
""
"Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you"
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
"But my darling, I am still in love with you"

"But I guess you look happier, you do"
My friends told me one day Ill feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
""
"?Cause baby you look happier, you do"
I knew one day youd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that Ill be waiting here for you
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
"Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down"""
"But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink"
""
"Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know"
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
""
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
"He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home"""
""
"I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up"
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
""
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
""
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
"He said, ""Hallelujah, you're home"""
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
"Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance"""
""
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
"She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?"
"Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?"
"She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun"
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
"Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar"
"Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance"

"You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band"

You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the c??ili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
"Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week"
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
"I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine"
"Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine"
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
"And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy"
"And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three"

Maybe just the touch of a hand

And the crowds don't remember my name

"She said ""don't you worry if I disappear"""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
"But then I jumped right in a week later, returned"
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
"She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend"
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
"Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin"

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means

I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
"I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?"
"Oh, honestly?"
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm

Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time

I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch

What the future holds cause it's another day

Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors

"Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax"
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now
""
"Mmm, come on and take it back, love"
Come on and take it back for us
"Don't you fade into the back, love"
No
""
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
"With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news"
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
"And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm"
"Whispering, ""Everything that happens is from now on"""
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
"Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids"
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
"I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it"
"This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now"
""
"Mmm, come on and take it back, love"
Come on and take it back for us
"Don't you fade into the back, love"
"No, I'll take it back now"
""
"Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect"
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
"Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus"
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
"Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless"
"Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition"
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
"Vividly, need to let my liver be"
"And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends"
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
"'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally"
"It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but"
But I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
"Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely"
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
"Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made"
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
"The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down"
"That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now"
""
"Mmm, come on and take it back, love"
Come on and take it back for us

"My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme"
"Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?"
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
"Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me"
We forget 90 percent of it when we wake
"But the other 10 percent, it never fades"
"Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads"
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
"Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more"
A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
"Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit"
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
"I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss"
And most of these other guys are kids that pose
"His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is"
"Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it"
"Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower"
You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow
Igh!
I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
"Never getting dry, so I get high"
"Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on"
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

"So am I close to you anymore, if it's over"
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that
"I never wanna settle down, come around"
Break up the love like Lego now
"Never wanna turn into another ""like you"""
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views
"Everythings great, not everythings sure"
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
"Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous"
On the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
"I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative"
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

"Because, if I was gonna go somewhere"
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down (wo-oahh)
"And thinking I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground"
"Keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low"
"Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered"
From all that I've done wrong
"And I'll know you'll say, that I'm the only one"
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
"Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer"
Could you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
"When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay"
"Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed"
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
"We go anywhere, our minds would take us"
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you dont even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes

And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone
"Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits"
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
"I disappear, you call me selfish"
I understand but I cant help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and its too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder
""
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
"Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say"
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
"And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV"
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets
""
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love

And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me

So Ill take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up

In four months you're brought to life

Before you let him take you

It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind

I'll make your little secret public
"It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons"

Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me

Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad

But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off

And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
"And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill"
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
"Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ?"
"It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me"
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be

Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
"My dad wasnt down with that plan to attack, intends to show love"
I dont wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints I guess that God knows that
I dont wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
"Tie both shoe laces, and hope that"
"Things change, but for now I'll leave town with a backpack on my shoulder"

I love him from my skin to my bones

It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
"But just for tonight, hold on"
""
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light

"Listen, little lady"
"This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday"
"You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes"
"Lady, the word ""rape"" sums up events that take place every night"
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
"But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker"
Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in

She's just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
"And she don't wanna go outside, tonight"
Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

"Little lady, your mind you've made up"
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
"You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just"
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
Cause all the heroin is making you age
But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never coming back?
She put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan
"He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer"
"Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn"

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life

Straight down the line

"Little lady, you're trembling with fear"
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
"You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear"
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now
"The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you"
"The same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""Who you working for?"""
He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're having a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
"Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard"
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
"Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid"
"Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own"
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
"And then a voice says, ""Where you been bitch? I wanna know"""
"No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness"
"You open the front door, he boots you in"
"There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror"
"Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error"
"He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight"
"At this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped"
And all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye
"And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece"
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her 13th birthday
""
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
"And we don't wanna go outside, tonight"

For angels to fly
For angels to fly
"Fly, fly"
For angels to fly
"To fly, to fly"
Angels to die
"I feel it, can you feel it tonight?"
I feel the fire between you and I
"I mean it, don't you turn off the light"
"Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no"
"She was like ""Damn?"
"Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
So don't make plans
"For nothing but me and a lil' romance,"" hey"
"You and I, whiskey on ice"
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh-my-my-my
