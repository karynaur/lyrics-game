"Just promise me, you'll always be a friend"
"But then again you should know, Nina"
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
This feels like falling in love
Kickin' back in a way that we do
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
Deep shit if anybody finds out
So in love
I feel the chemicals
I'm in love with your body
"Kiss me like you need me, rub me like a genie"
I'm so in love
And I said that's fine
Found my heart and broke it here
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
""
""
Love can change the world in a moment
Then I turn the music off
"Girl, you know I want your love"
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
I'll be drunk again
"Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye"
"Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love"
Another one to take the sting away
And you will never know
And I've been known to give my all
"Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio"
"And all this time, God knows I'm singing"
No farewell
All by myself
Anymore
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Just four months then torn from life
""
That he really wants to know my name?hey
"(Hey, hey, hey)"
""
And I know that there's a limit to everything
Every day discovering something brand new
"This time, we'll fade out tonight"
"I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun"
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)
From lust to truth
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
So in love
"Going through the motions, going through us"
I'm falling for your eyes
No goons that were never in gangs (Gangs)
"Come on now, follow my lead"
But  it
All by myself
"We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves"
""
"In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him"
And your heart's against my chest
"He said, ""Teddy, never get off your high horse"
Barcelona
"But the other 10 percent, it never fades"
Just how beautiful you are to me
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out)
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die
Come on and take it back for us
But good things are over fast
Ripping out the pages
Take aim and reload
That's the way to break my?
"I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind"
Barcelona
And I'll carve it like this necklace

"He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime"
You're having a conversation you could be murdered for
So can I lean on you?
Oh?I?oh?I?oh?I?oh?I

"We are, we are, we are"
"She said ""don't you worry if I disappear"""
"Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you"
If I told you I loved you?
It's late in the evening
"Ooh, you're there for me when I"
"Spread love and understanding, positivity"
"Jump in that water, be free"
""
And maybe it's all part of a plan
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Now keep it on the down low
We wish they would disappear
"Ayy, ayy"
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street

""
""
Like nobody ever could
"Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now"
No farewell
Then you cross me
"For how long long I love my lover, now, now? (and I feel love)"
"You and I, whiskey on ice"
Make it rain

"Even so, and just the same"
I think the braces are breaking and it's more than I can take
"I never wanna settle down, come around"
"Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error"

You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
"See, Im real, I do it all, its all me"

And if you're broken I'll mend you
So in love

"Go on and tear me apart, and hold on"
"You need me, man, I dont need you at all"
Make it rain
"You need me, man, I dont need you"
"I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight"
Calling out across the line
"Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love"
You got the kind of look in your eyes
I was rolling up something with you
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
I'm in love with your body
You can wrap your fingers round my
"Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty"
Let's leave the party
I don't love you baby
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
And I think that you should know that
So don't call me baby
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
I never intended to be next (you bastard)
""
""
And people that talk too much
You're strumming on my heart strings
"Come on, set the tone"
Oh Nina
You're still gone and I'll say
Put your faith in my stomach
"Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard"
And I wont be a product of my genre
"(Anything she needs, she can call me)"
"And my father told me ""son"
I met this girl late last year
"Love, on me, o-o-on me (On me)"
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
"(Anything she needs, she can call me)"
"For how long long I love my lover, now, now"
But that's my fault (Oh)
That's the?
That's the way to break my heart
"2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number"
"To carry love, to carry children of our own"
"I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene"
"But still, I'm just keepin' it real"
Want to be your man
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
Tears remind you you're alive
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home)

Wont you let me know
"And you know, everything changes but"
And the crowds don't remember my name
One works down by the coast
Make it rain
"Nosotros, vivir la vida"
"I'm out of touch, I'm out of love"
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
"Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime"
"Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind"""
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
You wanna be loved
All the voices in my mind
Oh?I?oh?I?oh?I?oh?I
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
I don't wanna know about your new man
And colour you in
I see fire
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Come south of the border with me (Rrrat)
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it

And they scream
But ain't nobody need you like I do
""
I dont wanna runaway
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them

"I could fall, or I could fly"
"M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover"
Love can change the world in a moment
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Another place to let their hearts collide
"And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need"
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Of all the comrades that e'er I had
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
"Cause thats you and me both, Nina"
"For how long I love my lover, now, now?"
"Bust it up, a rain forest, it be pourin', yeah"
"No, I'll take it back now"
Conversations with my father on the A14
Before I dive right into you
"And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse"
"You should love me, you should know"
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
"Come south of the border, border"
"And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself"
"Give a little time to me, or burn this out"
I've been spinning now for time
"Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water)"
You know I'll fight my corner
"Weary-eyed, dry throat"
"And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown"
"Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet"
"With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one"
"Jump in that water, be free"
Spending my life
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
"And thinking I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground"
Not knowing what it was
I can see the stars
How long you leaving?
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah"
For four years I never had a place to stay
"This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday"
A man may fight and not be slain
"We got questions we should not ask, but"
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

I'll put my future in you
That all of my words will always be low

You wanna be loved
So take me back to London
You might be left with my hair
Oh yeah
"Just promise me, you'll always be a friend"
But then the devil took your breath away
And you should never cut your hair

Just know that Ill be waiting here for you
See I could do without a tan
'Cause if it was meant to be
Stumble and fall with head spin I've got
"Surrounded, but still alone"
The only evidence that you've been here before
I don't want you no
"We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright"
This drink is a liver killer
And my brother and all of my family
"I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind"
So tell me when it kicks in
Go ahead and just live it up
And it falls just where it needs to be
But my heart will stay the same
"Every year, he goes to M?laga with all the fellas"
""
"But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me"
That's the?
I feel the chemicals
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
Go ahead and just live it up

And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
I'm in love with the shape of you
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground

That's the?
Why the hell does she love me
"Oh, I think that you should know"
When you're on my road walking me home

"My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme"
The moment that I saw her
And you ain't got nothing on you
Burn in my bloodstream
I want you to know its enough for me
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
And never ever let you down
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing
"Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus"
Weigh down in my soul
"But I was younger then, take me back to when"
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And musically Im demonstrating
So before I save someone else
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
In Barcelona
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Can you feel it?
""
And I don't wanna know
Names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
"From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh yeah"
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
If you love me
Like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way
All of these stars will guide us home
"Oh, won't you leave me now?"
Before I dive right into you
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
Let me remind you of the days when
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
Don't hold me down
Just how beautiful you are to me
And they say
"I see fire, hollowing souls"
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
"Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision"
""
Anymore
But she fell in love with an English man
I got everything I need in this room
Made friends and lost them through the years
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
""
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
"Cause you need me, man, I dont need you"

Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Good night and joy be with you all
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather

"And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight"
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
Before I dive right into you
I don't wanna know about your new man
"Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both"
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
"She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home"
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
But we're still unaware as why
'Cause you and I
This one will bring it back whole
"Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind"""
Come south of the border with me
She put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan
""
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
""
I love him from my skin to my bones
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Told you I'd let them go
We're falling in love
To make the choice and leave
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
It's all for you
Break up the love like Lego now
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
Make it rain
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
"Well get up, up on the dancefloor tonight"
""
"Ripped gloves, raincoat"
""
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
"Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?"
"In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid"
I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
"Oh, won't you leave me now?"
"Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah"
And I saw scars upon her
Stealing kisses in a front yard
""
My mind's with you but my heart's just not
And where it goes wrong
I see it in your movements tonight
Down by the Wexford border
Place don't close until we wanna leave it
And they gon' sing like this
Searching for a sweet surrender but this is not the end
People grow and fall apart
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
And one of these days I might just show that
And I wont ever let you go
"We found weekend jobs, when we got paid"
My pretty little Galway Girl
And then the devil took your memory
So in love
All my senses come to life
"Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar"
I need you darling
"Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car"
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
"A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes"
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
But she fell in love with an English man
So maybe we could get down now
"Say, boy, let's not talk too much"
"And it's the only thing that I know, know"
So let me give it to ya
""
""
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home
Friends just sleep in another bed
"But where I'm heading, who knows?"
Anymore
"We are not beautiful, yeah"
"Come on, be my baby, come on"
"She was like ""Damn?"
Don't care about religion
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
""
From your head to toe
"I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up"
But when I broke the industry
"On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name"
We keep this love in a photograph
Welcome to the new show
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Only a month we've been apart
"My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl"
And out of all these things I've done
Barcelona
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
And just stay with me
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
"I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up"
"Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"""
"And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece"
I'm in love with your body
Been this way since 18
LOUDER!
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
My dad was wrong
Alas it was to none but me
""
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
""
Make it rain
"Spread wings in the clouds, getting high"
Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in

Over the castle on the hill
"""Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"""
"Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right"
"Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit"
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
With a pebble held in my hand
""
Hands in your hair
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
"Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted"""
And all I've done for want of wit
"A little crazy, but I'm just your type (Okurrr)"
"Come on now, follow my lead"
All the voices in my mind
""
"Baby, I'm so in love with you"
"I could fall, or I could fly"
Barcelona
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
"Together, or solo"
"But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song"
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
"Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'"
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
"And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV"
Before you let him take you
When you're half asleep
I saw you lookin' from across the way
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And went from sleeping at a subway station
And they wanna know what you're about
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And I was William Sheeran
You know hearts don't break around here
""
"And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh"
"Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance"""
Spending my life
It's not like we were both on tour
Things were all good yesterday
Over the castle on the hill
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
So keep 'em on with nothing on
"Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)"
I could try to smile to hide the truth
Under the clothes we take off
"Legs open, tongue out, Michael Jordan, uh (Uh)"
"I'm out of touch, I'm out of love"
And you'll be all right
Make it rain
So can I lean on you?
"Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)"
""
"Home, home, home, home"
You know I'll never change
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
"Everyday, I be seein' her and Ceiline, oh yeah"
"And Ted said, ""That's just the way things go"""
Take aim and reload
"And we don't wanna go outside, tonight"
""
""
"Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'"
I understand but I cant help it
"My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick"
Maybe I waited too long
""
If you cross her
Crumbling like pastries
You are my one and only
To memory now I can't recall
"Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)"
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
"But me and her, we make money the same way"
Ever since you went to uni
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
"Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn"
"""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?"""
"Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeh (Yo'; wuf!)"
"My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl"
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
But they don't know me yet
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
"I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell"
And you ain't got nothing on you
"No, I just wanna hold ya"
Right in front of me
If you cross her
"And you're not the only one"""
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
"Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded"
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
And I said that's fine
For angels to fly
Let's leave the party
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
I don't love you baby
And all of the lights will lead
If you don't believe it
I want you to know its enough for me
When you wake me up
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
"You need me, man, I dont need you"
Make it rain
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

For most of the night
"Ayy, ayy"
"I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya"
The arms of the woman I know
"Come on, be my baby, come on"
And things were all good yesterday
And all my friends are in the club
"Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded (Gettin' faded)"
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
"Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous"
For angels to fly
I need you darling

I don't even know if she knows what for
But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag

"Come on, get involved"

"Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean"
"Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat"
"Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en m??, est?s temblando"
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
So live life like youre giving up
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
When I met the woman I would call my own
"Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know"
"I wondered, do you see them too?"

Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you

Thumb and hold me tight

"And I see fire, hollowing souls"
"For how long I love my lover, now, now?"
"Fly, fly"
"For how long long I love my lover, now, now"
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
We'll be strangers if we see this through

Down your shoulders and back

Thumb and hold me tight

We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

"Don't worry about her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me"
Down by the Wexford border
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
Everything is already part of a plan
"I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys"
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
"I see fire, burning the trees"
"Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue"
"Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?"
That heart is so cold
"Now I see fire, inside the mountain"
"Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made"
Like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way
In that house that your brother bought ya
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
I hit back when the pen hurts me
That's when I broke your heart
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Hoping that you'll understand
"Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me"
"Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know"
I don't love you baby
"Singing to ""Tiny Dancer"""

"Slowly sinking, wasting"

"You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band"
In four months you're brought to life
"Fingers and thumbs, baby"
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
You cut me wide open like a landscape
"Call girl, no phone"
Come on and dance with me in Barcelona
I got sinning on my mind
"Oh, why, oh why am I alone?"
One's already on his second wife
"Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well"

"Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become"
And maybe we found love right where we are

"It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but"
How can I live without love?
Give me love

"With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news"
You never changed your mind
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
Come fill to me the parting glass
"But then again, if we're not friends"
So don't call me baby
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
"Come on, be my baby, come on"
"Oh, I been on for a thousand nights"
The shit that I go through each and every day
And I don't ever wanna run around
"And she don't wanna go outside, tonight"
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
"And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day"
From New York out to London
"My dad wasnt down with that plan to attack, intends to show love"
"You need me, man, I dont need you at all"
Come south of the border with me
It never came from my mouth
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
That's the?
I already know if she's a keeper
Back to the time you were lying next to me
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now
For angels to fly
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
And they scream

"Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love"
Trust and respect is what we do this for

"With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans"
"Never getting dry, so I get high"
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
I guess that's how I know you
My three words have two meanings
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Oh?I?oh?I?oh?I?oh?I

Every day discovering something brand new
Lumiere darling

Angels to fly

I found a love for me
Love flows deeper than the river
You know hearts don't break around here

I've got to save myself
Used to be two hearts in love

Every time that I'm alone with you

Nancy was my yellow rose
If we should ever do this right

"Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say"
All that I can hear is music from the back
I hope that heaven is your resting place
"Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"""
I told her she knows
"For they're designed to be together, oh"
"Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen"
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim

Down by the Wexford border

Open bottles of beer but never champagne

The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Stuck in her daydream

Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
So tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind

Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls

On the summer day when I proposed

Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case

Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
(Love will come and Love will go)
Wont you let me know
""
And I hope that you remember me
Always 30 minutes behind
We push and pull like a magnet do
All by myself
So don't wipe your eyes
I don't love you baby
Another place to let their hearts collide
But more people hear me though
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
You got to see the person I have become
"Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition"
"Hey, baby, we can dance slowly"
"And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need"
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
You wanna be loved
For angels to fly
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
"You need me, man, I dont need you"
"I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware"
""
"Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance"""
"Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love"
And you know that it's true
"L.A., mmm, drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)"
"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah"
"Go explore in (Woo, woo) somethin' foreign (Skrrt, skrrt)"
We are surrounded by all of these lies
"You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Under the covers where we used to lay
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
"And I've been on the road, so long she couldn't call my line"
Make it rain
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
""
Baby I apologize for it
"And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like"
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
"Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye"
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So live life like you're giving up
"Did I, did I do something wrong?"
This is how it ends
And last night you were in my room
And oh
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
Calling out across the line
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
Stuck in her daydream
(People grow and fall apart)
They would wish me one more day to stay
I'll never let you down
"Ayy, ayy"
"My daddy told me, ""Son, don't you get involved in"
Over the castle on the hill
""
All I can do is wonder where you are
"Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in"
No one say hi to me without her
And now we're left here in the pain
"Come on, let's be free in Barcelona"
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
If you feel you're fallin'
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
How can I be what you want?
And what a way to find out
"Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know"
""
Guess she went wandering off with it
I'll be taking my time
"Never wanna turn into another ""like you"""
""
"Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym"
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
You wanna be loved
"I'm out of touch, I'm out of love"
"To fly, to fly"
Couple women by my side
""
"Hey, baby, we can dance slowly (Hey)"
""
"I said it, then forgot what I said"
And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do
And out of all these things I've done
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
"Put your, put your, put your worries on me"
I never really want to believe this
I was rolling up something with you (Wuh!)
How would you feel
That I should rise and you should not
Against yours now
""
""
Maybe I'll get drunk again
""
"I wont stay put, give me the chance to be free"
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
I'll do it all for you in time
"New York to London, different city every day, yeah"
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
"Come on, be my baby, come on"
And rests peacefully
Lumiere over me
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
First love never dies
Why the hell do you love me?
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it
But these people raised me
Put my home in a suitcase
20 years old is when I came in the game
Only words bleed inside these pages
And your mind is my new best friend
""
You wanna be loved
Wo nooma (be ye ye)

"Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ?"
We're just tryna figure everything out
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
""
And your eyes turn from green to gray
We were sitting in a parked car
It's not complicated
See the flames inside my eyes
"""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"""
You know I love watching you do your thing
It's not complicated
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
(But you can make it on your own)
"Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go"
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Straight down the line
And put you on a wall
""
""
It's just something that I want to do
Don't fuck with my love
But maybe I'm just in love
"And if we should die tonight, we should all die together"
I love him from my skin to my bones
Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
"I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine"
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
You got a girl that could finally do it all
It's what I need to stay strong

"Call yourself a singer-writer, youre just bluffing"
I got everything I need in this room
But you're the only one that knows I lied
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Nah nah nah nah nah
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
"And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed"
""
And you're miles away
"So come on, and let it go"
"With stadium heights, with Damien Rice"
Last night you were in my room
That will safely guide me home
"You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs"
"But they ain't got nothing on you (Ah, ah)"
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
"Yeah, you look happier, you do"
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
"Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes"
"Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Getting high)"
Should this be the last thing I see
She is the lighthouse in the night
So tell me that you love me too
""
"I see fire, blood in the breeze"
I'm just drunk again
""
I'm in love with the shape of you
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
"Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip"
"Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go"
Then you cross me
"Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time"
And I'll never let you down
"Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits"
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
Glass on the side

Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
"Melody music maker, reading all the papers"

I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
Every moment that I spend with you
That's the way to break my heart
I guess you know I've been away
I'll tell you it's about time
And all my friends have gone to find
"Quiero comentarle que no s?? qu?? pas??, ah"
If you don't believe it
And unlike most women I know
But you're the only one that knows I lied

"For how long long I love my lover, now, now?"
"Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye"
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
All over my home
So let me give it to ya

Someone else might love you too
"Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper"
"Star sign, Gemini"
"Ooh, I can't wait to get home"
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
To put it all on me
"And she don't wanna go outside, tonight"
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
And never ever let you down
So let's pretend we're dancing in the street
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
""
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
All I can do is wonder where you are
"Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing"
To feel a little love
"Ayy, ayy"
"S?? t?, te adoro, se?orita (Barcelona)"
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
Your body is my ballpoint pen
"Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep"

I won't stop until the angels sing
"Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox"
We'll get there eventually
"I try to be strong, but I got demons"

And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
"I want you to be mine, lady"

"And that's stadiums, man are aliens"
We just try to keep those secrets in our lives
And your brother always beats me
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
'Cause we're just under the upper hand

"Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower"
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Come south of the border with me

"Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but"

Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
You need me

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
Now absence can make your heart ache
For how long long I love my lover? (feel it all over now now and I feel love)
"There's no difference, I assure ya"
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
Wait for me to come home

I was twenty-four years old
"But my darling, I am still in love with you"
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor

"So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights"

But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
"Float down, like autumn leaves"

"I won't be changing the subject, I love it"
Should I? Should I?
Five sons and three daughters

Flawless diamonds

"Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love"

"Keep a lil' blade in her fuckin' lip gloss kit, ayy"
And for how long I love my lover?
This is my only fear: that we become

From your head to toe

If things go wrong we can knock it down
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
"And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone"
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
"You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just"

We forget 90 percent of it when we wake

Now I know I have met an angel in person
Your lips pressed to my neck
Then you cross me
So why would I quit?
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing

'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried

Hunger more profound

Without you to hold I'll be freezing

"Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights"
I feel safe when you're holding me near
And my father and all of my family
How can I see through the dark?
Don't tell me you need me

And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

Between the devil and the danger

All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)

And I'll keep you around so I'll know
LOUDER!
I know we'll be alright this time
Tell me that you love me too

Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye
"Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely"
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
"And the rest of the year, the same"
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
"And I've been living on the road, Nina"
But she fell in love with an English man
Cause you are the only one
Your arms are where I wanna remain
"I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene"
""
"He want the lil' mamacita, margarita (Margarita)"
"And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today"
""
You never live 'til you risk your life (Life)
"New York to London, different city every day, yeah"
I don't even know how much I made this year

She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
"Make it rain down, lord"
Oh won't you leave me now?
""
And go mad for a couple of grams
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
I'll whisper quietly
Now I don't wanna hate you
"Be my girl, I'll be your man"
"M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover"
"Bardi, uh"
Every day discovering something brand new
""
"(Don't worry about her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me)"
I knew he had his eyes on you
And I was William Sheeran
And my brother and all of my family
And I've been known to give my all
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
People fall in love in mysterious ways
"Home, home, home, home"
"Am I your lover or Im just your vice? (Woo, yeah, yeah)"
"Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now"
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Make it rain
Here in your aeroplane
But if I don't
She took my name and then we were one
Her lips upon mine
"Now, what you not gon' do"
"Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine"
But I know I was happier with you
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
All my senses come to life
And I get drunk a lot
Oh?I?oh?I?oh?I?oh?I
"Its been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but"
""
I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
"You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here"
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
Every day discovering something brand new
""
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
And all of the voices surrounding us here
"Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance"
I was rolling up something with you
For angels to fly
We made these memories for ourselves
"I see fire, blood in the breeze"
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
"I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can"
"It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons"
But you're the only one that knows I lied
""
Give me love like never before
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
(feel it all over now now and I feel love)
Brokenhearted
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
Are all over written on the signs
"Put your, put your, put your worries on me"
"Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead"
""
For angels to fly
Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
Then you cross me
And I'm not scared of passing over
I see it in your movements tonight
"So come on, and let it go"
"Anything she needs, she can call me"
We're falling in love
""
But you're the only one that knows I lied
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
I'm still the same as a year ago
She is the river flow in Orwell
Holding me close until our eyes meet
Then you cross me
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
"Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go"
"White lips, pale face"
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
"Well, that's the way to break my"
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
"'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense"
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views
Unless you mean it
"You should go, Nina"
"I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles"
That heart is so cold
Ended over U-N-I
And I've got no plans for the weekend
"For nothing but me and a lil' romance,"" hey"
""
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
"Dont wake up, this love is like a dream"
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
I'm in love with your body
I'll never keep it bottled up and left to the hands of the coroner
""
"Oh, maybe I came on too strong"
I bought an AP to help me time keep
"And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes"
"You should go, Nina"
"And time's forever frozen, still"
In my eyelids now (What?)
"Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound"
One's just barely getting by
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes
I do it to forget things about myself
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
""
"(Anything she needs, she can call me)"
""
Even my hand does sometimes
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
Maybe you're my snowflake
"If you were here, I'd sing to you"
""
"Come on, be my baby, come on"
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
If I told you I loved you?
And I'll make you a heart pendant
I dont wanna know where he's been lying
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
""
He's waiting for the time to move
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
""
And wont stop until the angels sing
"When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay"
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
"Man, you know that she drives me crazy"
'Fore it grows out of the ground
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
That heart is so cold
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
Cause you're waiting for me
"You need me, man, I dont need you"
A man may drink and not be drunk
And they say
If you love me
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
Make it rain
Let it go until our roads are changed
"Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to"
""
You're strumming on my heart strings
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
LOUDER!
Bibia be ye ye
Oh I'll never let you down
Give me love like her

You're the song my heart is beating to
Our hearts were never broken
I feel the chemicals
Goes mad for a couple grams
Up in my headphones to Holocene
Been this way since 18
""
I don't wanna know about your new man
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
Lumiere over me
And we don't want to go outside tonight
'Cause you act like you are
And I saw scars upon her
People fall in love in mysterious ways
"For they're designed to be together, oh"
Good night and joy be with you all
"M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover"
The way our horizons meet
SING!
Holding me close until our eyes meet
I've been looking for a lover
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
"That she ain't the one to play with, oh no"
"Push up on me and sweat, darling"
"The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile"
"Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)"
And there's no other girl like you
Tell me that you'll turn down the man
"See, Im true, my songs are where my heart is"
"Make it rain down, lord"
Maybe just the touch of a hand
"I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow"
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar
"Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you"
"I want you, baby, solamente"
And it's dark in a cold December
""
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
I think I love you better now
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
"'Cause I heard you do, mmm"
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
Don't fuck with my love
"Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep"
And don't tell me you need me
Wait for me to come home
"It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no"
But you're the only one that knows I lied
And I said that's fine
Sell love to another man
"When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me"
Can you feel it?
I could be persuaded to hold on
"She was like ""Damn?"
"And oh, I've known it for the longest time"
I'm falling for your eyes
I think I love you better now
But you don't know that my girl been doin' CrossFit
""
"Mamacita, rica"
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
"Come on now, follow my lead"
"Come, come on now, follow my lead"
Take aim and reload
"Thats you now, ciao, seems that life is great now"
"(Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now)"
"Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid"
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Make it rain
"Come on now, follow my lead"
And out of all these things I've done
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
Lie down with me
"Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night"
"Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you"
Sundown and they all come out
She's just under the upper hand
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
"Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before"
"Cause thats you and me both, Nina"
"Now I see fire, inside the mountain"
"Yeah, I was born a misfit"
""
"That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear"
Feel it rushin' through you
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism

There's just one thing I remember
I'm in love with your body
"And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now"
It's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried

"I may be crazy, don't mind me"

The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
"You need me, man, I dont need you at all"
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?
And all my friends are in the club
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
Cause you are the only one
And you're the one when I want love

And yesterday you were here with me
"Love me, give me love"
"It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no"
Why the hell you love me so
"Should I, Should I?"
It's FRED again

Cold as stone in the kitchen light
"Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down"""
"200 a night, end of 2010"
"And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory"
"And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh"
Calling out across the line
"Jump in that water, be free"
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
"Come on, be my baby, come on"
We'll get there eventually
And take my passport out again
"Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine"
"Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love"
"Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?"
Maybe I should let you go
"And I've been living on the road, Nina"

"Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same"
Bibia be ye ye
We are not beautiful
Lumiere over me
'Cause from now until I go
Against the dying of the light
But with that said give me one more
"South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone"
You look perfect tonight
Where our eyes are never closing

You're practically my family
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
So you can keep me
Have ever been and I'll never leave again

"Anything she needs, she can call me"
"'Cause you gotta see me, never leave me (Never leave me)"
"And lately, everything's making sense, too"
'Cause if it was meant to be

I don't need you baby
And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
"Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown"
"Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain"
Make it rain
To feel a little love
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
And I'll be standin' so close
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet
It's you and only you who can be takin' away
Never reach the poor
"And time's forever frozen, still"
I just want to be in Barcelona
"And you're not the only one"""
My pretty little Galway Girl
I told her she knows
I'll be drunk again
"Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance"""
I'm in love with your body
"Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar"

"God, make me another one"
Love will come and love will go

About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

"When you're with him, I know you're lonely"
Are you happy in someone elses arms?
This is what Im gonna do
So take me back to London
"Promise that I will not take it personal, baby"
See the flames inside my eyes
Barcelona
"Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you"
And if you know me like I know you
"The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket"
Stealing kisses in a front yard
"Drop top, designer clothes"

Make it rain
"You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat"
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
He's not the right guy for you
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover
Good night and joy be with you all
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
I'm on my way
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
And all my brother and my sisters
I know when I have children they will know what it means
"Oh, I been on for a thousand nights"
"Oh, honestly?"
And you're miles away
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
"Four cities, two planes, the same day"
All because she got a card on her 13th birthday

So I could take the back road
"Another day, another life"
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I saw people marching in the streets today
When we did not know the answers
Or the thought of growing old
"You need me, man, I dont need you"
"Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina"
Under the clothes we take off
Even my dad does sometimes
You always try and get me to stop
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
Disappearing all night
"No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say"
In Barcelona

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court

So open your eyes and see
"I can't work it out, how"
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
I guess you know I've been away
"Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina"
Desde que salimo' por la tarde lo' do'
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves

Tell me when it kicks in
Crumbling like pastries
So in love
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
Keep it deep within your soul
"I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef"
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
She was Nancy Mulligan
"Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now"
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
"It's like the riches of grandeur, oh no"
Don't care what the DJ chooses
I know what I wanna do
Somehow

"And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride"

I've travelled the world
"Now I see fire, inside the mountain"
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
So inside we'll rage
"Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer"
I don't wanna love you no
If you loved me how'd you never learn
"When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful"
And time's the only reason that we could break up
The way our horizons meet
Go ahead and just live it up
I stay more celibate than in a monastery

We push and pull like a magnet do
We used each other's air just for the people to see

Get lost in the rhythm of me
Beautiful people
And me and her have something different
When you wake me up
And all the contents are all over the floor

Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
The worst things in life come free to us
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
How can I be what you want?
And shows me how to love myself
"Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?"
Just close your eyes

"Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed"

All the voices in my mind

All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
"Oh, I think that you should know"
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
"Home girl, only right she in a proper tee"
A life with love is a life that's been lived

Walking down 29th and park
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels

My mind will always be stronger than my songs are

Love can change the world in a moment

I went away for months until our paths crossed again
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes

Don't care about religion
Kickin' back in a way that we do

All the voices in my mind
A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
"And nobody's comin' close, yeah"
"Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes"
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
From your head to toe

Ended over U-N-I
