"Were gonna get it, get it together right now"
Confusion that never stops
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Just an alien
"Still I call it magic, when I'm next to you"
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
Or do something that's never been done
Just an alien
"I wonder where they'll go, ah"
So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
"Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure"
And I crawl back into your open arms
"Were gonna get it, get it together right now"
It's as good as mine
Look how they shine
""
What's really going on below
While we froze down below
"If you love me, won't you let me know?"
But I don't know if I can
"Another's arms, another's arms"
Some things you have to believe
"My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison"
When something is broken
"'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars"
""
I see the road begin to climb
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
When the truth is
"We sat on a roof, named every star"
"Oh, to the head, oh"
I sing oh-oh-oh
'Cause I can't help thinking
I drew a line for you
"I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't"
Always
But the beautifullest treasures lie in the deepest blue
"From the moment I wake, 'til the moment I sleep"
"Into life, Ive just been spoken"
""
You and me are drifting into outer space
Didn't we have fun?
Target movement
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
""
You've got a rocket; eyes on the prize
"And you wonder when you wake up, will it be alright?"
That we shoot across the sky
Open up your eyes
"Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes"
She'd dream of para-para-paradise
See it all disappear without trace
"And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble"
'Cause you were all yellow
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
""
Got a tattoo and the pain's alright
She expected the world
Look at the stars
Some saw the sun
"Cold, cold water"
"And if you love me, won't you let me know?"
But that was when I ruled the world
People couldn't believe what I'd become

I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Every tear
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom

Para-para-paradise
"Muhammad, Mahatma, and Nelson"
"Up and up, up and up"
Oh nothing else compares
And leave me down here on my own
Go
"Gonna get it, get it together and go"

Sometimes they arrive
"But when Im cold, cold"

"Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh"

Your guess is as good as mine

I got some dragons and they're
You came to rain a flood
"And in confusion, confidence"
Back and get drunk with my friends
Shoot an apple off my head and a
"Oh no, I see"
"Oh, I can feel my heart beating"
Para-para-paradise
I'll be waiting in line
On everyone
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in

I can hear that sound
When I was so heavy
But I wait for it
Just turn it on

As an unexpected visitor
And I swerve out of control
"(Woo hoo, woo hoo)"
"Light a fire, a fire, a spark"
"All summer, we just hurried"

That green eyes
"We were always meant to, always meant to"
"Oh no, I see"
I want to be with you 'til the world ends
Driven to distraction

Everything is upside down
No one ever said it would be so hard
"Oh, it was a wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall"
A head full of dreams
Tell me your own politik
"Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo"
If you want to
Because I came here with a load
And if you feel the love

"Leave a light, a light on"
Birds go flying at the speed of sound
That green eyes
So I turned to run
"Stare into darkness, staring at doom"

"Amazing day, amazing day"
Just tell me you love me
In the future where will I be?
"Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal"
""
When they smash my heart into smithereens

Cause you make me feel
"It's in your blood, It's in your blood"
'Cause you light up the path
Meet under sun and
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"One, two, three"

"""I know it's over,"" Icarus says to the Sun"
"Gonna get it, get it together and flow"
On everyone
And time is on your side
Got to find yourself alone in this world
I don't want to be a soldier
Not pushing you down and all around
"Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions"
"Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure"
Oh ohhhh
"Like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple"
"On a concrete canvas, Ill go making my mark"
Where I wanted to go
"Up and up, up and up"
As good as mine (as good as mine)
Wherever you are
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Want anybody else but you
And singing

"All the boys, all the girls"
And if you were to ask me
I'd not be stuck here in this hole
For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come

Used to be you here beside me
Yeah I do
Oh and I'm just waiting till the firing stopped
'Cause everyone hurts
Used to be your arms around me
"Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk"
It's all I can
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
"Gonna get it, get it together and flow"

Have brought me down upon my knees
Moving target
"And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble"
"Yeah, we share the same blood"
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
"Gonna get it, get it together somehow"
And in the light just streams
I miss you
Oh-oooh-ooh
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone
I'm sick of the secrets
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Ah-ah-ah
""
Some search for gold

Tides that I tried to swim against
You'll go higher than they've ever gone
Comme deux ruisseaux (You could be me)
Fly on
In you I see someone special
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved

When you got me lost for words
"Stand here beside me baby, watch the orange glow"
Gonna keep dancing when the lights go out
"(So high, so high)"
""
"Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me"
All of us are done for
I haven't slept
We mean no harm
You're such a heavenly view
I've never felt this way before
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
And they call as they beckon you on
"Another's arms, another's arms"

"Up, and up, and"
"Still, I wont let go"
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Where there are miracles at work
"I know it's over, an ocean awaits for a storm"
You and me are drifting into outer space
As good as mine (as good as mine)
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Come on and sing it out
Wish that your arms were around me
That I miss you so
"It's so cold, it's so cold"
Closing walls and ticking clocks
"Oh, I"
"And in your arms, I just wanna sway"
I'm learning from the news
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Look at the stars
Be what you want to be
""
Saying it's the very same steeple
And saw the sun
And it feels so much lighter since I've met you
She say
Pray before the dawn
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh)"
I swam across
In a world I hadn't seen
"Homes, places weve grown"
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
Trying to repair it
"Then I'll wait for you, yeah"
""
"Well, I'll change for good"
Hold me
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Hallelujah
Call me
Still believe in magic?
That's what she told me
"'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars"
Well be glowing in the dark
Comin' home and I'm finding no peace
You've got fire in your eyes and when you realize you'll go further than we've ever gone
On the skyline
"Gonna get it, get it together somehow"
Clearly I remember
Moving in the dead of night
""
"Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh"
When I was yours and you were blind
The lights go out and I can't be saved

""
Yeah the truth is
No one ever said it would be this hard
Tears stream down your face
And you cut me loose
For the thirst and for the hunger
"We sat on a roof, named every star"
""
"Music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future"
Life is short as the falling of snow
Some bent the bow
"I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time"
It was dark
For you I will always be waiting
"Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo"
And you were an island to discover
"Come on all for love, out from the underground"
"From the top of the world, top of the waves"
Some things you can invent
If you don't then lie
""
""
And that's just torture to me
I call it magic when I'm with you
Every teardrop is a waterfall
I'm gonna put it six feet underground
One minute they arrive
Don't you shiver
In the darkness before the dawn
"In this adventure, oh then I"
"Oh, I think I landed"
That I shoot across the...
Pulling the puzzles apart
Until Monday morning feels another life
"Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me"
"Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you"
A bigger one
"Come back, come sing it"
"Get a degree, good job, 401k, but Im trying to turn ks to m, what does it take?"
Stuck in reverse
"Gonna get it, get it together and flower"
Everyone loves
"Oh, I think I landed"
"She went, woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo"
Be a cartoon heart
Carry your world
When am I going to see
"A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing?"
"Stood on a bridge, tied to a noose"
Together
Look at earth from outer space
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
"We were always meant to, always meant to be"
"Boom boom ka, buba de ka"
You know I love you so
Come sailing us home by the light of the moon
Of course I do
But you never even see me
Heal it up
I want to know when I can go
Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Start as you mean to go on
"For you, I've waited all these years"
Into smoke Im turned
"And I know, and I know and I know"
Or write a song nobody has sung
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
"Every tear, every tear"
The call never came
The wheel breaks the butterfly
""
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Green eyes
Ready to fall up
Where I wanted to go
You've got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
"And I, I never meant to cause you trouble"

"I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care"
"Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised"
"I was lost, oh yeah"
Were lines that I couldn't change
Always
It's you that I hold on to
"Wait for your call, love"
"Baby, when your wheels stop turning"
For a lifetime
When I'm feeling ordinary
Always in my

Green eyes

But one last time
For some reason I can't explain

We are diamonds taking shape
"He went, woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo"
Of the spacetime

Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off
"Come here, oh my star is fading"
Ah when you see it then you'll understand

I sing it loud and clear
Open up your eyes
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So I look in your direction
"And ah, when you work out where to draw the line"
My missionaries in a foreign field
And then I looked up at the sky
Can you hear that sound?
"And give me love over, love over, love over this"
But for the missile monsoon
""
Into life Ive just been woken
"And I know, and I know and I know"
Fall like the rain
It's easy to be lethal
I'll carry your world
"Oh, let's go back to the start"
Fish fell out of water
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Open up your eyes
"Trouble's on the outside, I know"
"In the night, the stormy night, she'll close her eyes"
In the future where will I be?
"Boom boom ka, buba de ka"
I don't know which way I've come
All I can think about is you
They fly on
"No I don't, it's true"
"So if you love me, won't you let me know?"
Do not speak as loud as my heart
We took photographs just some just so
Now you could run and just say theyre right
"Tanzaku stars, lasso the moon"

"But you pay me no attention, do you?"
"We could have been lost, we would have been saved"

It's such a perfect day
"I swear you, emerge blinking into"
"Leave a light, a light on"

We are diamonds
"Yeah, it's true"
"I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't"
A flock of birds
"Every tear, every tear"
Without you it's a waste of time
And youre with me wherever I go

Lights will guide you home
Doesn't mean you've won

"All that noise, and all that sound"
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Come on rage with me
"In water rolled, salt"
"Yeah, how long must you wait for it?"
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Fixing up a car to drive in it again
"'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars"
I can't wait 'til the morning
Ride through

Everybody was for fighting
"Away over on the rooftops, let's get married"
How long before I get in?
Been here and there and then I've
When the pain just rips right through me
My heart is yours
"Leave a light, a light on"
Without you it's a waste of time
All I know
Everyone must find their place
If all that I'm on earth to do
"And give me love over, love over, love over this"

And I always
"Look up, I look up at night"
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?

"For you, I'd bleed myself dry"
"So high, so high"
"And I know it's over, a parting of ways"
That I could never go on without you
When the truth is
And I'll always be waiting for you
And dream of para-para-paradise
All I know
"I was lost, oh yeah"
When I was so thirsty
This could be para-para-paradise
"So I race for it (yeah, yeah)"
So much that it hurts
Back and get drunk with my friends
Oh-oohh
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Cursed missed opportunities
At first light
I guess we'll be raised on our own then
"Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel"
Yeah I lift and I'm mesmerized
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
"And we are legends, every day"
""
(So I race for it)
Or am I part of the disease? Singing?
"You say, ""Oh, sing one you know"""
It's all I can do
All that we fought for
"Oh, take me back to the start"
Put my hands up to the sky
"Running in circles, chasing our tails"
Planets are moving at the speed of light
And put a smile upon your face oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

To tell me it's alright
"And fight til it's over, fight til it's done"

Same fucking blood

Para-para-paradise
Gonna come back and take you home

"But then, maybe we could again"
"And we'll be birds, flying free"
I know it's over before she says
It's such a perfect day
But I don't forget
God gave you style and gave you grace
And it hurts like heaven
"Another's arms, another's arms"
"You could be?me,?I could be?you"
Turn into something beautiful
"Stare into darkness, admit defeat"
As you mean to go on
"Yeah, we do, yeah, we do"
Then you can call me Khaleesi
"We could have been lost, we would have been saved"
"Up and up, up and up"
I know what you've got
"Boom boom?ka, buba de ka"
"Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones"
"Yes, I do"
And were writing and saying
Were lines that I couldn't change
Here I am and I'll wait in line always
We were just about to lose our home
We live in a beautiful world
"Oh, did you want me to change?"
In the darkness before the dawn
Or see each sunrise as a gift
A head full of dreams

But on and on

The drummer begins to drum
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And he would know just when and what to sow
Trouble that can't be named

"Light a fire, a flame in my heart"
Late night watching TV
Dont let 'em take control

Just a flock of birds
Pull yourself into me
"Questions of science, science and progress"
Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized
A warning sign
"Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon"
"Such a long, long time"
"But others are puzzles, puzzling me"
Never gonna be a saint
Don't let the fears just start 'What if

"Honey, all the movements you're starting to make"
That you'll always get your way
You've got bright in your brains and lightning in your veins
Ill be armed with a spraycan soul
And put a smile upon your face
"No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end"
You came along
"When I should, but I cant let you go"
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
I feel my heart underneath my skin
"Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me"
And that was when I ruled the world
Bird stuck on the ground
But I won't let you down
And I'm dying of thirst
Meet me in blue sky
"Oh, you make me feel"
""
"Give me real, don't give me fake"
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
"Call it magic, call it true"
"It's so cold, it's so cold"
You came to lift me up
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing
"Where do we go, nobody knows"
Queen of the Meereen
Just won't be led
Crystal ball can foresee a change
"So if you love me, why'd you let me go?"
"Leave a light, a light on"
""
In your tears and in your blood
But you just sit down there and you wonder why
One minute they arrive
It's on your side now
"Put your wings on me, wings on me"

My missionaries in a foreign field
Have come all around
"I wanna die in your arms, oh, oh, oh"
"I need someone, someone who hears"
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
I missed the good part then I realized
Oh honey honey
"'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars"
"So fly on, ride through"
"One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah"
And I saw sparks
Carry your world
Got so many names
"Baby, it's been a long time coming"
Don't ever give up
This could be para-para-paradise
"Yeah, when you work it out I wanted to"
"Oh-oh, whoa, oh"
Open up your eyes
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
He say
"When I'm low, low, low, low"
To set me free
And I know the mistakes that I made
You're the one that I wanted to find

Late night watching TV
Oh-oh-oh
Everything is falling all around you
"No I don't, it's true"
"Yeah, when you work it out I wanted to"
"Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me"
You might be a big fish
Such a heavenly view
Oh who would ever want to be king?
That's alright
"You said drink from me, drink from me"
""
Bring me 'round
""
"Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo"
Come the conference of birds
And I won't stop now
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
"Climb up, up in the trees"

Rosaleem of the Damascene
Back and get drunk with my friends

"Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you"
If you could see it then you'd understand
When I'm dead and hit the ground
Oh-oh oh-oh
"Come on, oh my star is fading"
""
""
But it flew away from her reach
It's just a warring rain
All I can think about is you
So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk?
You know you make my world light up
"But now, all I can think about is you"
"No I don't, it's true"
"Honey, you are a rock upon which I stand"
Luminous and wired
And it's done
Fly on
"Or you could turn and say no wait, theyre wrong"
Like I'm alive again
They spun a web for me
Fly on
People moving all the time
Every teardrop is a waterfall
""
"Singing out, I never meant to cause you trouble"
Just an alien
I know you don't listen to me
Am I the?future or the history?
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
(So I race for it)
They fly on
Trying to repair it
They were sitting on the strawberry swing
Love is the only thing left that's true
In the rain
"And I'm gonna buy this place, that's what I said"
""
"Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?"
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
It's no cause for concern
""
""

""
But nothing's too broken to find a way back
I think I see you
My army of one is gonna fight for you
Oooo-ooo-ooo
All the madness that occurs
"Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones"
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
""

So tell me you love me
"Oh, I think I landed"

"Bones, sinking like stones"
It's such a shame for us to part
Shiver
Everyone cries
"And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't"
Welcome and entertain them all!
And I feel my heart beating
When the banks became cathedrals

Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
You can say its mine and clench your fist
"With a head full, a head full of dreams"

"And I know, and I know, and I know"

Hallelujah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If we've only got this life
Hovering above
Tell you I set you apart
Like I'm alive again
"Been around the world, universe too"
"Oh, all that I know"
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Must be out of their minds
On everyone
In the rain
"My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah"
Tears stream down your face
Flock of birds
And I asked
Together
Without you it's a waste of time
Every door I ever tried was locked
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Then it hurts like heaven
Know someone else has taken your place
Give me heart and give me soul
Late night watching TV
Am I a part of the cure?
Dont ever give up
Once you'd gone there was never
I wanna love you
"I turn the music up, I got my records on"
"All that noise, and all that sound"
"Gonna get it, get it together and go"
Some will laugh and some just sit and cry
In your fire and in your flood

""
Hold tight for everyday life
Theres a light that you give me when Im in shadow
Seas would rise when I gave the word
I know what I've got
And say you'll come and set me free
"Carry your world, and all your hurt"

And it was all yellow
"When you get what you want, but not what you need"
Yes
So you take a picture of something you see
"Another's arms, another's arms"
We live in a beautiful world

"Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure (yeah, yeah)"
I want to be with you 'til the whole world ends

And thought of all the stupid things I'd said
Got to pull you close into me
"Next you know, theyre gone"
"And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't"
""
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
"Music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future"
Doesn't mean I'll stop
"So if you love someone, you should let them know"
When the pain just rips right through me
But on and on
To show you how it all began
How in the world am I going to see
All that time she was silent still
Just because I'm hurting
"Gonna get it, get it together somehow"
You can say what you mean
Im feeling drunk and high
Just open up your eyes
And I know I'm dead on the surface
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes

He said I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall

Qui se rassemblent (I could be you)
All that matters in the world

To show you how it all began

Saying float like an eagle

Well be glowing in the dark
It's all I can do
And I want you to know
Running to a faint
"With you, with you"
Pray before the dawn
Just look what Amelia and Joan done
Cause you reign
"The sun on snow, rivers in rain"
"Under this pressure, under this weight"
"Rastafarian, Targa..."
Two angles of the same view
"Put my hands up to the sky, feeling like (yeah, yeah)"
"And it's you I see, but you don't see me"
I got a rocket; eyes on the prize

"Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold"
"Searching for the water, hoping for the rain"
Give me peace of mind and trust

Want anybody else but you

Flock of birds

I took my love down to Violet Hill

My army of one is gonna call it through
See the forest there in every seed
Don't you shiver

"Honey, you are the sea upon which I float"
I think I saw you

Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls

See the arrow they shot trying to tear us apart

Some momentary awareness comes
And we live in a beautiful world

Now I feel my heart beating
"As good as mine, as good as mine (as good as mine)"
And ignite your bones
You came along
"This, I guess"
Look up to the sky
Look how they shine for you
"Oh, angel sent from up above"
We were hovering without a home
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
La-la-la-la-la
And do back the things it did to you in return
"Yeah, how long must you pay for it?"
"So I put my hands up to the sky, I feel alive"

Always in my

Around here you never want to sleep all night
"I said, oh"
"Oh, didn't we have fun?"
"I had it once, I lost it though"
In the swirling of the storm
Every river that you tried to cross
And get to keep on dancing all life long
I don't wanna follow Death and all of his friends
Look how they shine for you
My nerves are poles that unfroze
And call it true
And time seemed to say

"Homes, places weve grown"

Open up your eyes

Turning toward it

This particular diamond was extra special

Upon which I stand

If you don't then lie

So I guess Id better stay

Para-para-paradise

Coming back as we are
Into smoke I'm turned and rise

Hallelujah

Anyway you can
Millions are UFO

Steal my heart and hold my tongue
How come theyre out when they dont know the facts?

And then I looked up at the sun
Oh-oh oh-oh
Ride through
For some reason I can't explain
Open up your eyes
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
"Were gonna get it, get it together right now"
With my head stuck under the sand?
You've got bright in your brains you can break through those chains you'll go higher than we've ever gone
"So high, so high"
"In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly"
So on a concrete canvas under cover of dark

I think I see you
Tears stream down your face
Im so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
"Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one"
Some far away
"Oh, and I'm gonna buy this place that's what I said"
Wish that you were here beside me
I want to know when I can go
Sometimes they are gone
Pouring to put out the pain
Fly on
"Turn your magic on, to me she'd say"
Listen as the crowd would sing
Meet me where I said
Nobody said it was easy
Every gun you ever held went off
How long do I have to climb
And high up above or down below
And you cut me loose
And I always
One minute I held the key
And I will try to fix you
"Is a, is a waterfall"
But it won't change a thing

We were walking up to strawberry swing
You've got fire in your eyes I see heaven inside you'll go further than we've ever gone
Tears stream down your face
Some dragon to slay
Hold my head inside your hands
Diamonds ate the radio
And it was all yellow

"Just to see if you care, if you care"
"Yes, I do"
That you'll always get your way

In the swirling swimming on
And I know I was wrong

You as my brother

"All winter, we got carried"

"In my place, in my place"
"Oh, did you want me to change?"
Tulips the colour of honey today
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off
So golden and opportune
Before I know what it feels like?

"Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure"
"Oh-oh, whoa, oh"
It's such a perfect day
Baba would go where the flowers grow
Anyway I can
"And ah, when you work it out I'm worse than you"

He said I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
I know the falls that the water face
"Yeah, I saw sparks"
Believe in love...
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Shared every bruise and showed every scar
Just an alien
You're always in my head
"Nothing's really making any sense at all, let's talk"
Green eyes
Japan and China all lit up
"Every tear, a waterfall"
"?What if they say Im no good? What if they say ""Get out of here, kid. You got no future?"
And if we've only got this life

Fly on
Be a bright red rose come bursting through concrete
Meet me on the road

All that we fought for

Somewhere out there

Call me Daenerys Targaryen

All those places I got found
'Cause everyone hurts
In a little pond

Now the sky could be blue
In you I see someone special
"And though you might be gone, and the world may not know"

"'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?"

There we sat in snow
Crossing your eyes
Fearless together

Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet

Hollowed out to fit their rifles

Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Now you could run and just say theyre right
""
"Said I can't go on, not in this way"
Para-para-paradise
All I know
"I hear you laugh, I heard you sing"
A flock of birds
"It's my only weapon, army of one"
""
And I know the mistakes that I made
""
Is there someone there to reach me?
And every tear's a waterfall
Some heard the gun
"Leave a light, a light on"
"Stare into darkness, staring at doom"
And we live in a beautiful world
And you came along and you cut me loose
"Oh, what a thing to do"
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah you could be someone special
Need a brand new coat of paint
Like I'm alive again
Some saw the smoke
"'Cause I, I'm about to explode"
In the unknown
I want to know when I can go
When she was just a girl
"Come on, oh my star is fading"
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
""
""
The rain
"Been innocent, but a sinner in me"
We come in peace
And I will try to fix you
They say start as you mean to go on
Take the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
See it all disappear without a trace
""
"'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars"
"Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo"
And fighting with my weak hand
""
I'll carry your world
Tied to a noose
You?are?
And you
"Amazing day, amazing day"
Come on and sing it out
"Up, and up, and up"
"Guilty of nothing, but geography"
"So start falling in love, start the riot and"
I started looking and the bubble burst
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Following ?em up
And ignite your bones
"Were gonna get it, get it together I know"
I'm gonna give you my heart
When you got me open-handed
(Home) Home
""
So I twist and turn
Look up to the sky
"Another's arms, another's arms"
If you could see it then you'd understand
"No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end"
"I was lost, I was lost"
"Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak"
You're always in my head
When you're too in love to let it go
"Saying my heart is my gun, army of one"
""
""
"Oh, you use your heart as a weapon"
I wanted to say?
This could be para-para-paradise
And be standing there beside you
I want to walk in a two
"I could be you, you could be me"
""
Aah-aah-aah
"Give me strength, reserve, control"
I want to know when I can go
"Pyramids try, Babylon too"
It's a fools gold thunder
"Bones, sinking like stones"
Boom
""
"And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't"
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
And it seems like troubles
"""I struggle with the feeling that my life isnt mine"""
"Come back, come sing to me"
"When I was down, when I was hurt"
"Turn your magic on, Umi she'd say"
I think of you
"Don't say it's over, don't say we're done"
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
That we shoot across the sky
How long before you decide?
"Yeah, I saw sparks"
""
Not scared to be strong
And well be birds
And you know how much I need you
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
"Fly on, ride through"
I think youre so cool
"Yeah, we do, yeah, we do"
""
Look how they shine for you
Back and be young again (yeah)
"No I don't, it's true"
So well soar
Don't you shiver
"Before it starts, before I begin?"
Look at what everybody's going through
"Oh, didn't we have fun?"
"So high, so high"
But you pay me no attention
"You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored?"
"Oh, I want to know when I can go"
""
"I turn the music up, I got my records on"
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
You?are?
So much that it hurts
""
Got to make our own key
"I cry, oh"
And singing
Never so high as when I'm with you
""
"I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't"
Let me shoot across the...
"Just need love, Just need love"
""
"We said forever, forever always"
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
"And with all your magic, I disappear from view"
Look up to the sky
"Saying it's true, it's not what it seems"
"My heart, boom, b-boom, boom"
Para-para-paradise
"And ah, when you work out where to draw the line"
I call it magic
"Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure"
"Oh, didn't we have fun?"
"It's true true, woo woo oo-oo-oo"
I'll start before I can stop
"So high, so high"
Sees the light and says
""
I came here with a load
"Put my hands up to the sky, feeling like"
Following them up
Only I own me
"Honey, you are a rock"
It's a guidebook for the blues
Ahh-oohh
My missionaries in a foreign field
But someone had put the flares up and got me in the rays
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
Poured on a symphony
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
"Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you"
Inside a perfectly straight line
"Gonna get it, get it together and flower"
Wouldn't wanna change a thing
Could be blue
"Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes"
"Boom boom?ka,?buba de ka"
Never an honest word
For it
And the view; the whole Milky Way
""
Close your mind or take a risk
All I know
Want anybody else but you
""
"So come over, just be patient and don't worry"
Without you I'm just miles away
Ive been trying hard to reach you 'cause I dont know what to do
For it
'Cause you and me
But if you want to
"I've been around flying, baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do"
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through
""
This could be para-para-paradise
"Every tear, every tear"
After all that we've been through
"When you try your best, but you don't succeed"
When you fly wont you
And I discovered that my castles stand
"And now, Im gonna miss you, I know"
Come on in
""
"And it was called ""Yellow"""
Well be glowing in the dark
""
Fly on
"Yeah, how long must you wait for it?"
Very scary and
""
"Amazing day, amazing day"
Feels like there's something broken inside
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
"And you get a head, a head full of dreams"
"I say, oh"
A rush of blood to the head
"A spider web, and it's me in the middle"
"Well, I'll change for good"
"(Woo hoo, woo hoo)"
Now it's sunrise
"Oh, you use your heart as a weapon"
Everyone tells each other all kinds of lies
"And I just got broken, broken into two"
"To me, me"
I jumped across for you
"'Cause yeah, everybody here's got somebody to lean on"
Can the birds in poetry chime?
Sometimes the wire must tense for the note
Cherubim Seraphim soon
""
Come out of things unsaid
Alive again
But didn't we have fun?
Still I always
""
Cathedrals in my heart
To make the stars come out
Or a light that I couldn't see
"Wanna fall, fall so far"
On everyone
Is that I'm lost
Maybe one day Ill fly next to you
I miss you
And mine
And nothing else compares
See me crumble and fall on my face
You become my best friend
"From the moment I wake, 'til the moment I sleep"
Yeah the truth is
""
You?are?
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
""
Now my feet won't touch the ground
""
"Now, now"
"A patch, a corner"
And I know that youre with me and the way you will show
Nobody said it was easy
When I was a river dried up
When it feels like the end of my world
When you wanna reach me
""
""
Oh again and again
It's on your side now
Thats how you think of love
Is a chance you seize
Sweep the streets I used to own
Away with me
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
It's all I can
"When youre in pain, when you think youve had enough"
My father said never give up son
Trying hard to speak
"""Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?"""
I've got to say I wasted all your time
"Gonna get it, get it together and flow"
""
Call it true love
Could be grey
This could be para-para-paradise
"Were gonna get it, get it together I know"
Every moment was so precious
Because each has been sent as a guide
Tired and underprepared
""
"Fearless, fearless, fearless"
And dreamed of para-para-paradise
""
""
"Yes, she had eyes like the moon"
And say you'll come and set me free
"I wanna fall, fall so hard"
See me crumble and fall on my face
The drummers begin to drum
"If I, if I'd only waited"
"I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh"
"Oh, meet me by the lane"
Give me heart and give me soul
I don't mind
""
And you're always in my head
""
And all along the fire below
And it's you I hear so loud and so clear
""
We live in a beautiful world
That you were an island and I passed you by
""
So much that it hurts
But I am screaming underneath
Cause now I always want to feel this way
""
I hope you understand
""
Sing it loud and clear
Or do something that's never been done
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
"It's so cold, it's so cold"
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through
Everyone cries
Pull yourself right through me
"La, la, la, la, oh?"
When it's such
"Yeah, that's what I do"
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
"Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo"
"It's true, look how they shine for you"
Poured on symphony
"But when Im cold, cold"
"Be my mirror, my sword and shield"
I used to rule the world
Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
Everybody gets their hearts ripped out
I drew a line
"The sword sinks in, lightning strikes"
In the rain
""
They spun a web for me
God give me style and give me grace
""
Indigo up in heaven today
""
"But, come on, don't give up, don't say we give in"
"And I know, and I know, and I know"
""
"Cause I never say die, aim never untrue"
"I was scared, I was scared"
"Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me"
Oh now I think I must be miles up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And anyone who tried to deny you
See a bird soaring high above the flood
"To me, me"
Cause they fly away
"So you can hurt, hurt me bad"
"Boom boom ka, buba de ka"
Stood on the edge
Oh-oooh-ooh
Just wanted a way of keeping you inside
"""Let me in, unlock the door"""
Tell me you love me
Call it true love
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
"Be my mirror, my sword and shield"
When I don't know what I mean
Birds came flying from the underground
""
Your body on my body
"And said drink from me, drink from me"
""
We live in a beautiful world
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
I don't mind
"La, la, la, la, oh?"
"Got a tattoo that said ""together thru life"""
When you lose something you cannot replace
Fly if you want to
How come theyre out to get us?
Not pushing you down and all around
""
I know when I'm lost
""
Fly on
I need someone who understands
I came along
Pour on a...
But time is on your side
Before I see things the right way up
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
"On every street, every car, every surface, a name"
And you feel like you're going where you've been before?
And threading the needle
"The rain, the rain"
So I crawl back into your open arms
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
The sign that I couldn't read
And I swear I waited and waited
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
""
And I see no chance of release
When the world means nothing to me
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
So how come things move on? How come cars dont slow?
Symphony
Could it be worse?
"Show me the way, Lord"
""
"And we swore on that night, wed be friends 'til we die"
"Oh, didn't we have fun?"
I'm Queen of the Andals
They fly on
It never moves
"I feel my time, my time has come"
...Not my enemy?
""
""
I can hear your heart beating
Blame it all upon
When you
I'll carry your world
"So high, so high"
Someone there to find me?
"Until my day, my day is done"
How come people suffer? How come people part?
But didn't we have fun?
No better and no worse
Oh-oh oh-oh
Used to be you here beside me
There's nothing here to run from
When it's such
"A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle"
And ignite your bones
Hold me tight
Sing it out
When the future's architectured
