"Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

Ahh-oohh
Ahh-oohh
Oh-oohh
Oh-oohh"
"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world"
"When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you


Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you"
"Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called ""Yellow""
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry

It's true, look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do"

That we shoot across the sky

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

You said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Now Im feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me

Poured on symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends, every day
That's what she told me

Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Alive again
Oh, you make me feel

"Oh, they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial

Like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple
So how come things move on? How come cars dont slow?
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should, but I cant let you go

But when Im cold, cold
When Im cold, cold
Theres a light that you give me when Im in shadow
Theres a feeling within me, everglow

Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night, wed be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And now, Im gonna miss you, I know

But when Im cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that youre with me and the way you will show
And youre with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling, this everglow

Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow"

And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still, I call it magic, such a precious jewel

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'll close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

La-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, ""Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh I know the sun must set to rise""

"The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing?

You? are?
You?ˇare?

Confusion that never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing?

You?ˇare?
You?ˇare?

Oh nothing else compares

With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
She say

I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again

Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune
He went, woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Tulips the colour of honey today
It's true true, woo woo oo-oo-oo
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom

"My father said never give up son
Just look how good Cassius become
Muhammad, Mahatma, and Nelson
Not scared to be strong

?What if they say Im no good? What if they say ""Get out of here, kid. You got no future?ù

Now you could run and just say theyre right
No, Ill never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say, ""No, wait, they're wrong""
And get to keep on dancing all life long

My father said never give up son
Just look what Amelia and Joan done
Oh Rosa, Teresa their war won
Not scared to be strong

Now you could run and just say theyre right
No Ill never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait, theyre wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long

Yeah you could be someone special
You've got bright in your brains and lightning in your veins
You'll go higher than they've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got fire in your eyes and when you realize you'll go further than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k, but Im trying to turn ks to m, what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve

Yeah you could be someone special
You've got fire in your eyes I see heaven inside you'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got bright in your brains you can break through those chains you'll go higher than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

In you I see someone special
Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on and you can't go wrong"
"Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up
See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up, it's saying

Were gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Were gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart?
Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up
See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, Just need love
When the going is rough, saying

Were gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Were gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say its mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift


Were gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower

Were gonna get it, get it together I know

Running to a faint
Need a brand new coat of paint
Found myself in trouble
Thinking about what ain't
Never gonna be a saint

Fall like the rain
Pouring to put out the pain
Oh again and again

Now I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized

It's easy to be lethal
I'm learning from the news
It's a guidebook for the blues
Saying it's the very same steeple
People want to choose
They just see it from different views

And threading the needle
Fixing my flame

Oh again, and again

All I can think about is you

Is solo, then what a lone poor shoe
I want to walk in a two


Go

Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love

Pray before the dawn
Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

A flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned and rise
Following them up

Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on

So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on

A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said

Oh no, what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

Oh no, I see
A spider web, and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble

Singing out, I never meant to cause you trouble
I never meant to do you wrong

Feels like there's something broken inside

Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Got a tattoo and the pain's alright
Just wanted a way of keeping you inside

"It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low
If you love me, won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross held aloft
Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze
And if you love me, won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below
So if you love me, why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?"

"In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

Millions of miles from home
In the swirling swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on"

I haven't slept
I think I do
But I don't forget
My body moves
Goes where I will

You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
Always in my

And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let me go
But one last time

Tell me you love me
If you don't, then lie
Lie to me

Remember once upon a time
When I was yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
And mine

So tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
Just tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me

And call it true
Call it true love
Call it true
Call it true love"
"In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I wait for it
And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it

Sing it please, please, please
Come back, come sing to me
To me, me
Come on and sing it out
Now, now
Come on and sing it out
To me, me
Come back, come sing it

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
Oh, yeah"
"They were sitting
They were sitting on the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious
They were sitting
They were talking on the strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing
Cold, cold water
Bring me 'round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold, cold water
What ya say?

When it's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't wanna change a thing
People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away

When it's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

Ah

Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Well the sky could be blue
Could be grey
Without you I'm just miles away
Well, the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time"
"So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention, do you?
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?
But on and on
From the moment I wake, 'til the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care

Oh, did you want me to change?
Well, I'll change for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say?

Don't you shiver
Shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me, do you?
And is this my final chance of getting you?
But on and on
From the moment I wake, 'til the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care, if you care

Oh, did you want me to change?
Well, I'll change for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say?

Don't you shiver
Don't you shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
For you I will always be waiting

And it's you I see, but you don't see me
And it's you I hear so loud and so clear
I sing it loud and clear
And I'll always be waiting for you

So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me"
"We sat on a roof, named every star
Shared every bruise and showed every scar
Hope has its proof put your hand in mine
""Life has a beautiful, crazy design""

And time seemed to say
""Forget the world and its weight""
And here I just wanna stay
Amazing day, amazing day

We sat on a roof, named every star
You showed me a place where you can be who you are

And the view; the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away
And in your arms, I just wanna sway
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oooh

And I asked
Can the birds in poetry chime?
""Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?""
Oh thanks God, mustve heard when I prayed
Cause now I always want to feel this way

Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Yeah, today"
"Flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
Thats how you think of love
And I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
?Cause they fly away
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on
Flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke Im turned
And rise
Following ?em up
Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
?Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know, theyre gone
The fly on
Fly on
Oh ohhhh
So fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day Ill fly next to you
Fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on

Dont ever let go
Dont ever let go
Dont ever let go
Dont ever let go"
"I know it's over before she says
I know the falls that the water face
I know it's over, an ocean awaits for a storm
The sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over, a parting of ways
And it's done

But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh-oooh-ooh

From the top of the world, top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost, we would have been saved
Oh, I
Now we're stopping the world, stopping its spin
But, come on, don't give up, don't say we give in
Don't say it's over, don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, didn't we have fun?

I know it's over before she says
Know someone else has taken your place
""I know it's over,"" Icarus says to the Sun
The sword sinks in, lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight til it's over, fight til it's done
Ah-ah-ah

But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh-oooh-ooh

From the top of the world, top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost, we would have been saved
Oh, I
Now we're stopping the world, stopped it in its tracks
But nothing's too broken to find a way back
So before it's over, before you run
Ah, didn't we have fun?

'Cause you and me
We were always meant to, always meant to be
We were always meant to, always meant to
You and me
We were always meant to, always meant to be

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?

But then, maybe we could again"
"He said I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
I'm gonna put it six feet underground
He said I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls
Oh, I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
And do back the things it did to you in return
Oo-oh, Oo-oh
Oo-oh, Oo-oh
Said I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh, and I'm gonna buy this place that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head

Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on

He said I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside me baby, watch the orange glow
Some will laugh and some just sit and cry
But you just sit down there and you wonder why
So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm gonna buy this place, that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Oh, to the head, oh

Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on
As you mean to go on

So meet me by the bridge
Oh, meet me by the lane
When am I going to see
That pretty face again
Meet me on the road
Meet me where I said
Blame it all upon
A rush of blood to the head"
"What in the world are we going to do?
Look at what everybody's going through
What kind?of?world do you?want it to be?
Am I the?future or the history?

'Cause everyone hurts
Everyone cries
Everyone tells each other all kinds of lies
Everyone falls
Everybody dreams and doubts
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out

How in the world am I going to see
You as my brother
...Not my enemy?

'Cause everyone hurts
Everyone cries
Everyone sees the colour in each other's eyes
Everyone loves
Everybody gets their hearts ripped out
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
Gonna keep dancing when the lights go out
Hold tight for everyday life
Hold tight for everyday life

At first light
Throw my arms out open wide

Hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah

"I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony

And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
Is a, is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still, I'll raise the flag

Oh, it was a wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
A wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall"
"Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
Into life, Ive just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
When you got me open-handed
When you got me lost for words
I sing oh-oh-oh

A head full of dreams
A head full of dreams
Into life Ive just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams"
"We were just about to lose our home
Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so
History has some to know
We were moving at the speed of flight

Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight

Just an alien

We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says

Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line

Just an alien
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phoning home
Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
For a lifetime

Just an alien
Moving target
Target movement
A patch, a corner
Of the spacetime
Just an alien
Turning toward it
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again"
"Oooo, wooo

Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

Oooo-ooo-ooo

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting through concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
Well run wild
Well be glowing in the dark

Oooo-ooo-ooo
Well be glowing in the dark
A-woo,-a-wooooo

All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room a-spinning goes
Well run riot
Well be glowing in the dark

Oooo-ooo-ooo

So well soar
Luminous and wired
Well be glowing in the dark"

And I come here to talk
I hope you understand
That green eyes
Yeah the spotlight, shines upon you
And how could anybody deny you

I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter now I've met you
And honey you should know
That I could never go on without you
Green eyes

Honey, you are the sea upon which I float
And I came here to talk, I think you should know
That green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you
Must be out of their minds

Because I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I've met you
And honey, you should know

Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up

All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand

Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ah when you see it then you'll understand

All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can invent
Some get made, and some get sent

Birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ah, when you see it then you'll understand"

Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop

Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
No better and no worse

I just got lost
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
Cause along may come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh and I'm just waiting till the firing stopped
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off

Been around the world, looking for someone like you

And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you

Been around the world, universe too
I've been around flying, baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
Tanzaku stars, lasso the moon
And be standing there beside you
Right when the storm comes through

Never so high as when I'm with you

I missed the good part then I realized
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses

I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

A warning sign
It came back to haunt me and I realized
That you were an island and I passed you by
And you were an island to discover

Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

Used to be you here beside me
Used to be your arms around me
Your body on my body

When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms, another's arms
When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms, another's arms

Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Is there someone there to reach me?
Someone there to find me?

When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms, another's arms
And that's just torture to me
Another's arms, another's arms
Pull yourself into me
Another's arms, another's arms
When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms, another's arms


Got to pull you close into me
Another's arms, another's arms
Pull yourself right through me
Another's arms, another's arms

Late night watching TV

Wish that your arms were around me
Your body on my body"

If I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole

Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control

I've got to get out of this hole

But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath

And time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to a noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets
Stood on the edge
Tied to a noose

You came along
And you cut me loose
You came along
And you cut me loose"

Ive been trying hard to reach you 'cause I dont know what to do
Oh, brother, I can't believe it's true
Im so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you

You can take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how do you feel
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done
Or do something that's never been done

So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk?
And you feel like you're going where you've been before?
You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored?
Nothing's really making any sense at all, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk"

I'm a rastafarian, Targaryen
I got some dragons and they're
Very scary and

Then you can call me Khaleesi
Got so many names
I'm Queen of the Andals
Queen of the Meereen
Yeah ! You can kiss m' sandals"

It's a fools gold thunder
It's just a warring rain
Don't let the fears just start 'What if
I wont see you again
Around here you never want to sleep all night
So start falling in love, start the riot and

Come on rage with me
We dont need words
And well be birds
Got to make our own key

Only got this moment
You and me
Guilty of nothing, but geography

Come on and raise it
Come on and raise this noise for the million people
Who got not one voice
Come on its not over if you mean it, say loud
Come on all for love, out from the underground

Away with me
We dont need words
Close your eyes and see
And we'll be birds, flying free
Holding on in the mystery
Fearless, fearless, fearless

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Fearless together
You said ?well go through this together

When you fly wont you
Wont you take me too?
In this world so cruel
I think youre so cool"

The call never came
Ready to fall up
Ready to claim
I'm ready for it all, love
Ready for the pain
Meet under sun and
Meet me again

In the rain
The rain

Behind the walls, love
I'm trying to change
And I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for the change
Meet me in blue sky

And fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction

I wanna love you

I don't know which way I've come

I need someone, someone who hears
For you, I've waited all these years

For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come
Until my day, my day is done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

And give me love over, love over, love over this
Aah-aah-aah"
"Some saw the sun
Some saw the smoke
Some heard the gun
Some bent the bow
Sometimes the wire must tense for the note
Caught in the fire, say ""oh""
We're about to explode

Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world

Some far away
Some search for gold
Some dragon to slay
Heaven we hope is just up the road
Show me the way, Lord
'Cause I, I'm about to explode

Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world

Carry your world, and all your hurt
(Carry your world)"
"(So I race for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
My heart, boom, b-boom, boom
Stare into darkness, admit defeat
Comin' home and I'm finding no peace

And I know, and I know, and I know
I know I'm unlocked
And I know, and I know, and I know
I know what you've got

So I put my hands up to the sky, I feel alive
You've got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
Put my hands up to the sky, that's alright
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I race for it)
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I race for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart go boom, b-boom, boom
Superhero, a masterpiece
Been innocent, but a sinner in me

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in love
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm lost

I just put my hands up to the sky, feeling like
Got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling like
You've got a rocket; eyes on the prize
Put my hands up to the sky
I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
So I race for it
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
So I race for it (yeah, yeah)
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I race for it)
And I know, and I know, and I know
I know what I've got
(So I race for it)
""X"" marks the spot
So I put my hands up to the sky, I feel like
You've got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
Put my hands up to the sky, feel it inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling like (yeah, yeah)
I got a rocket; eyes on the prize
Put my hands up to the sky; I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure (yeah, yeah)
Wherever you are"
"This being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor
Welcome and entertain them all!
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide"
"In a haze, a stormy haze
I'll be round, I'll be loving you always
Always
Here I am and I'll take my time
Here I am and I'll wait in line always
Always"
"Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
""Do you ever get the feeling that youre missing the mark?""
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
Written up in marker on a factory sign
""I struggle with the feeling that my life isnt mine""
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
See the arrow they shot trying to tear us apart
Take the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still, I wont let go
Still, I wont let go
Of you
'Cause you do

Oh, you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

On every street, every car, every surface, a name
Tonight, the streets are ours
And were writing and saying
Dont let 'em take control
No, we wont let 'em take control
Yes, I feel a little bit nervous
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax
How come theyre out to get us?
How come theyre out when they dont know the facts?
So on a concrete canvas under cover of dark
On a concrete canvas, Ill go making my mark
Armed with a spraycan soul
Ill be armed with a spraycan soul
And you
Oh, you

Oh, you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

Yeah, it's true
When you
Use your heart as a weapon
Then it hurts like heaven
Oh, it hurts like heaven"
"Baby, it's been a long time coming
Such a long, long time
And I can't stop running
Such a long, long time
Can you hear my heart beating?
Can you hear that sound?
'Cause I can't help thinking
And I won't stop now

And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone
On everyone

Baby, when your wheels stop turning
And you feel let down
And it seems like troubles
Have come all around
I can hear your heart beating
I can hear that sound
But I can't help thinking
And I won't look now

And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone
On everyone

On everyone
On everyone
On everyone
On everyone"
"Where do we go, nobody knows
I've got to say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face
Where do we go to draw the line
I've got to say I wasted all your time
Oh honey honey
Where do I go to fall from grace
God put a smile upon your face yeah

And ah, when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out I wanted to
And ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

Where do we go, nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face oh yeah

And ah, when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out I wanted to
And ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

It's as good as mine, it's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
Na na-na na-na num ma-na na-na
As good as mine, as good as mine (as good as mine)
As good as mine (as good as mine)
As good as mine (as good as mine)

Where do we go, nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face"
"All winter, we got carried
Away over on the rooftops, let's get married
All summer, we just hurried
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
And don't worry

No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't wanna follow Death and all of his friends
No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't wanna follow Death and all of his friends"
