Distant faces with no place left to go

""You're really dropping out. I think my battery must be low
Listen, if you can hear me, we're going to a place nearby, alright? Gotta go!""

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me
And said, ""Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?""
I should've said, ""No, someone's waiting for me""
But I called my girl up and said

""Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me""
""Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!""

Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

""Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me""
""Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low

I can't compare you to no one else, no one else

But could you stay the same, if nothing else?
No, I don't wanna share you with no one else, nobody else

Torn by the way your voice is changing on the phone
All this space in between us makes it hard to feel close to you (Close to you)

"I close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I want to let you walk away tonight without a word
I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling
OOoh, if you were here right now
I swear I'd tell you this

Baby, I do not want to waste another day
Keeping it inside, it is killing me
Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you (to you)
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I am tell you, every time you leave
I am inconsolable

I climb the walls (yeah)
I can see the edge, but I cannot take the fall (no)
I have memorized the number
So why cannot I make the call?
Maybe cause I know you will always be with me
In the possibility

No, no, no

I do not want to be like this
I just want to let you know
That everything I hold in
Is everything I cannot let go (oooh, cannot let go)
Cause Baby

Do not you know it baby
I do not want to waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say

That I could control this
Never thought that I would be left behind
That I was stronger than you, (baby)
Girl, if only I knew what I have done
You know, so why do not you tell me
(And I) I would bring down the moon and the sun
To show how much I care

Don't want to lose you now
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't want to lose you now
No no, or ever again

I have got this feeling you are not going to stay
It is burning within me
The fear of losing
Of slipping away
It keeps getting closer, baby
Whatever reason to live that I have had
My place was always beside you
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad
Your face just won't go away

"It takes a lot to know what is love
It is not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I do not think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I have had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I want to thank you for what you have done
In hopes I can give back to you
And be the perfect son

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

You showed me how to love
You showed me how to care
And you showed me that you would always be there
I want to thank you for that time
And I am proud to say you are mine

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me

I love you Mom"
"Who are you now?
Are you still the same or did you change somehow?
What do you do at this very moment when I think of you?
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?

No matter how I fight it
Can't deny it
Just can't let you go

I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

Now look at me
Instead of moving on I refuse to see that I keep coming back
And I'm stuck in a moment that wasn't meant to last (to last)

I've tried to fight it
Can't deny it
You don't even know


No, no
I wish I could find you just like you found me
Then I would never let you go (about you)

Though everything's been said and done (yeah)
I still feel you (I still feel you)
Like I'm right beside you (like I'm right beside you)
But still no (still no word) word from you"

Now I'm yours
You found me heartbroken, heartbroken
On the floor
Became my salvation, salvation
Through the mourn, yeah
You got me wide open, wide open
Now I'm sure

In a world like this where some back down
I, I, know we're gonna make it
In a time like this where love comes 'round
I, I, know we're gonna take it
In a world like this where people fall apart
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart
In a world like this
I've got you

And now I'm free falling, free falling
In your eyes
You got me still calling, still calling
No surprise
I never knew I could love 'til the
End of time, yeah

"Backstreet

We've been through days of thunder
Some people said we don't belong
They try to pull us under
But here we stand together and a million strong

Let's get on with the show (Let's get started)
Turn the lights down low (Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start (You were there)
We know who you are, and this one goes out to

Everyone, everyone, everyone (yeah)
Said this one goes out to you
Everyone, we're standing strong 'cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you

We've been inside the circus
We took the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
Whatever comes around we'll always stay the same (oh yeah)

Let's get on with the show (O, let's get started)
Turn the lights down low (Turn the lights down low)
You were there from the start (You were there)
We know who you are, we know who you are

Everyone, everyone, everyone (everyone)

Everyone, we're standing strong 'cause of what you've done (baby)
And this one goes out to you

"You don't run with the crowd
You go your own way
You don't play after dark
You light up my day
Got your own kind of style
That sets you apart
Baby, that's why you captured my heart
I know sometimes you feel like you don't fit in
And this world doesn't know what you have within
When I look at you, I see something rare
A rose that can grow anywhere (grow anywhere)
And there's no one I know that can compare

What makes you different, (alright) makes you beautiful (alright)
What's there inside you, (alright) shines through to me
In your eyes I see, all the love I'll ever need
You're all I need, oh girl
What makes you different, makes you beautiful to me

Hey, yeah yeah yeah
You got something so real
You touched me so deep (touched me so deep)
You see material things
Don't matter to me
So come as you are
You've got nothing to prove
You've won me with all that you do
And I wanna take this chance to say to you

What makes you different, (alright) makes you beautiful (alright)
What's there inside you, (alright) shines through to me
In your eyes I see, all the love I'll ever need
You're all I need, oh girl
What makes you different, makes you beautiful to me

You don't know (you don't know) how you touched my life (touched my life)
Oh in so many ways (so many ways) I just can't describe
You taught me what love is supposed to be
It's all the little things that make you beautiful to me (so beautiful)
Oh yeah, yeah

What makes you different, (alright) makes you beautiful (alright)
What's there inside you, (alright) shines through to me
In your eyes I see, all the love I'll ever need
You're all I need, oh girl

Everything you do is beautiful (so beautiful)
Love you give shines right through me (shines right through to me)
Everything you do is beautiful (ooh, ooh ooh ooh oh)
Oh, you're beautiful to me (to me)"
"Looking at your picture from when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night
Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

All the doors are closing I'm trying to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away


That since I lost you, I lost myself
No I can't fake it, there's no one else


'cause I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know"

For sentimental fools

The best of friends like sister and brother
We understood, we'd never be alone
Those days are gone, and I want you so much
The night is long and I need your touch
Don't know what to say, I never meant to feel this way
Don't want to be alone tonight

What can I do, to make you mine?
Falling so hard so fast this time
What did I say, what did you do?
How did I fall in love with you? Ooh, oh

I hear your voice and I start to tremble
Brings back the child that, I resemble
I cannot pretend, that we can still be friends
Don't want to be alone tonight

What can I do, to make you mine?
Falling so hard so fast this time

"Here we are
In the arms of one another
And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong
And love is right
For us tonight
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It is a place I have never been
And it comes from deep within
And it is telling me
That I am about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be if we are nothing more than dreamers
Who believe that we see no one between us
How can they be in my heart
And in my mind
When all I can find
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It is a place I have never been
And it comes from deep within
And it is telling me
That I am about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

I loved you from a distance
Thought I could not reach that far
I cannot believe how close that we are
When I look into your Spanish eyes
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It is a place I have never been
And it comes from deep within
And it is telling me
That I am about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes"
"Everybody knows that I was such a fool to ever let go of you
Baby I was wrong
Yeah I know I said we'd be better off alone
It was time that we moved on
I know I broke your heart, I didn't mean to break your heart
But baby here I am

Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you

I know you're in there and you can make me wait
But I'm not going away
It's the least that I can do, just to tell you face to face
I was lying to myself, now I'm dying in this hell
Girl I know you're mad, I can't blame you for being mad
But baby here I am


If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Hear my heart that's barely beating
You will see a different man

But baby here I am
Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you (come on)
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in? (let me in)
I was running from the truth, now I'm crawling back to you

Banging on your front door (darling)
My pride spilled on the floor
I was running from the truth, now I'm crawling back to you, yeah
Now I'm crawling back to you
Crawling back to you"
"Ooh Oh Oh

In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Oh-oh Oh-oh
I looked down
And my shirt's turning red
I'm spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice
In my ear
Like I missed you
Want you tonight

Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Oh-oh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
Oh-oh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)

Thought I moved
More than on
Thought I could
Fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone
Oh-oh Oh-oh
Hear the sound
Of a love so loud
I just can't
I just can't
Ignore this feeling
Said she misses me
And she wants me
Wants me tonight


In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest voice
A gunshot on the floor"
"Madeleine
What's up with those tears in your eyes?
What happened when you shut down
And all the amber lights turned into red
In the silence of your cave, you feel safe
You decorate it with velvet drapes
Outside you see the dark woods
But you don't know there's fields of gold ahead

Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you'll know
Help is on its way

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
Cause only you can Madeleine
Oh Madeleine

'Member when
You used to sit and watch from the bridge
And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out?
You wrote it in a notebook
And said someday that this would be a story to tell
And you'd put it in a movie
Maybe be the movie star
Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away

So hold on, don't let go
Hold on, and you'll know
Help is on its way

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come up again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise and live again
Cause only you can, Madeleine

Let the sunshine warm your heart today
So rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine

So rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise and live again
Cause only you can, Madeleine
Oh, oh, oh, Madeleine
Woah, oh, oh, Madeleine"
"We're not over

The roses you left me slowly fading to grey
Your coat on the chair and the scent of your hair I miss
The clock on the wall, it reminds me of all the better times
When we walked in the park and we whispered in the dark
And we laughed and cried

And I never knew alone
Wherever you are is home

Without your lips on mine, no the sun doesn't shine
And no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony, music that sings to me
No I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

Oh, I walked by the store where we sat on the floor and we ate like kings
And someone said, ""hey we're locking the door, no time to play""

And I never knew alone
Wherever you are is home

Without your lips on mine, no the sun doesn't shine
And no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony, music that sings to me
No I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

We're not over
We're not over
Without your lips on mine, no the sun doesn't shine
And no I can't
You know I can't breathe

(Yeah, no no I can't breathe)
Without your lips on mine, no the sun doesn't shine
And no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony, music that sings to me
No I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
(We're not, we're not over)
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
(Don't say it's over, don't say it's over)
Nooo"
"Hey yeah
That's the way I like it

Somebody told me that you're not my kind
So have I lost my mind?
You keep on doing all the things I like
You've got me hypnotized
But that's the way I like it

Girl, you make me want to move
It's the price I got to pay
For all the things you do
But I like it
Going to listen to the groove
And you got to listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it

Everybody come on

Oh mystery lady, you've got something I like
Tell me you're here to stay (ooh yeah)
You're dangerous, oh baby
Could you do me right?
Will you come out to play?
Because that's the way I like it

Got to listen to the groove
And you got to listen well
The way you do it
That's the way I like it

Everybody now
I like it
Everybody now
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on
I like it
Everybody come on
That's the way I like it
Everybody come on

Got to listen to the groove
And you got to listen well
The way you do it

That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
Everybody now, everybody now
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it
Everybody come on, everybody come on

Everybody come on, everybody come on
That's the way I like it"

"Even a lover makes a mistake sometimes
Like any other, fall out and lose his mind
And I'm sorry for the things I did
For your teardrops over words I said
Can you forgive me and open
Your heart once again? Oh yeah

It's true, I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart (oh yeah)

Whatever happened
I know that I was wrong, oh yes
Can you believe me? Maybe your faith is gone, oh, yes it is
But I love you and I always will
So I wonder if you want me still
Can you forgive me and open
Your heart once again? Oh yeah

It's true, I mean it (yes, it's true, yeah)
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true (it's true)
Without you I would fall apart, ooh

I'd do anything to make it up to you
So please understand
And open your heart once again

It's true, I mean it (oh, oh, oh)
From the bottom of my heart (from the bottom of my heart)
Yeah, it's true (yeah)
Without you I would fall apart (apart)

Without you I would fall apart
