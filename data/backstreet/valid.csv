And my shirt's turning red
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes
Somebody told me that you're not my kind

Crawling back to you

Torn by the way your voice is changing on the phone

Ain't nothing but a heartache

"But could you stay the same, if nothing else? (I know it's selfish)"
If only you would tell me girl

You know I can't resist
"Oh my God, we're back again"
Do not you know it baby
Without you I don't think I could live
Kinda get me go crazy
We've been waiting so long
Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
You started going out with so-called friends
"I know it's true, I know it's true"
(Rock your body)
Your heart is frozen over
I like it
And move it all around
'Cause it's the only one I've got (Yeah)
"Eh, eh, as long as I'm with you, I'm okay"
"What can I do, to make you mine?"
If you really want it good
""
"What you do to me, baby (What you do)"
"Oh, baby, yeah"
Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Just memorizing lines upon your face
""
I have no place to go
Banging on your front door
""
You touched me so deep (touched me so deep)
Your heart once again? Oh yeah
What you did as long as you love me (I know)
How your love's affecting our reality
Cause mom you always were
My heart is crying out for you
You showed me how to love
"That night bein' a long thing (Ah, ah, ah)"
"Over you again, oh yeah"
I'm going crazy over you
"Who you are, as long as you love me"
The roses you left me slowly fading to grey
"I don't care, who you are, where you're from"
""
Want you tonight
And I know in time that you will understand
Cause mom you always were
"Girl, I know we can win"
"What can I do, to make you mine?"
""
"It's true, I mean it"
"Yeah, haha, that's right"
'cause my faith is gone
We're not over
Just show ?em what youre made of
What happened when you shut down
The summer will come and
"I, I, know we're gonna make it"
"Is it just, just me? (Ooh)"
""
Can't deny it
I don't know what he does to make you cry
I'ma do whatever it takes
And said someday that this would be a story to tell
"Took my words, wrote them down, threw them out"
""
"Baby, please, I'm on my knees"
""
Too much adrenaline
Mom you always were
"There ain't no place, ain't no place like you"
Don't you see it's now or never
If you really want it good
Everybody jam (We've got it goin' on for years)
Even a lover makes a mistake sometimes
Cause no one else will ever take your place
""
""
""
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Your heart is frozen over
""
That's not what love's supposed to do
"Come on now, everybody"
Find someone who hits the spot honey (oh yes)
"Get down, get down"
Do-do-don't want you back
Do you really wanna be the last to know what it's all about?
"And it's so crazy, what you do (Hey, hey, hey, hey, what you do)"
And you never showed up where I happened to be
"Come on now, everybody"
That's the way I like it
"Two in a million, once in a life"
"Woah-oh, oh-oh (Baby, would you meet me)"
'Cause it's always darkest before the dawn
Could you do me right?
Kiss you with honesty
""
For just one kiss from you
"I really need you, oh"
But love is all I have to give
I've seen enough
"I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"""
"All you people can't you see, can't you see"
"I said it, there, I said it (Yeah)"
""
You keep on doing all the things I like
And move it all around
"To the beat now, to the beat now"
"AJ, hit it"
""
"Is it just, just me?"
What we can do for you
A little more better
To the truth between the lines
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
No one else comes close
"What you do to me, oh yeah (What you do)"
"Gotta question for you, better answer now, yeah"
And it's impossible to stop when I start
"But let me tell you now there are prices to fame, alright"
"You saw my picture on the Backstreet's Back, alright"
And now there's only five left to tell you
Looking for the right one at the wrong door
When we walked in the park and we whispered in the dark
Everybody come on
No surprise
I'll give you all of me (give you all of me)
Ne-e-e-ew love
My pride spilled on the floor
But there were things that made me realize (realize)
I want your lovin' and I want it right now
"Everybody, yeah"
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad
""
"Baby, don't bother telling me your reasons why"
"You're my daybreak, you're my California sun"
Is all I'm ever gonna need
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
""
I can't breathe
"When the only limit is the sky (Woo, woo, woo)"
"It's time for me to let it go, time for me to let it go"
"I know it's true, I know it's true, I know it's true"
Don't give loneliness a chance
All that I ever wanted (yeah)
"So rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine"
Got to get somebody slamming baby (oh yeah)
""
"I dont mean to drag it on, but I cant seem to let you go"
"We fit together, you make me better"
I know deep within my heart
"Now two years gone, nothing's been won"
And I never knew alone
"Your words are a symphony, music that sings to me"
Of the night
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
That leaves you battered and broken
""
Got to know just who to ask
""
To find a way back to your heart
"That even though it's selfish, oh"
The words to say
Don't want to lose you now
Everybody
"You are tearing us apart (my heart, my heart)"
"Like a lion, I will survive"
In your eyes
I know you're not
"(Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah)"
Everybody
"Woah-oh, oh-oh (Baby, would you meet me)"
They get sad and act out 'cause they're winning
"You're my Memphis, New York, New Orleans all rolled into one"
I wish that I could find the words to say
Babe he's got to be the best (tonight it's me)
"I breathe, oh"
"Never let 'em tick, tick, tick"
""
""
"Baby, I want you back"
The way you do it
"Brothers, sisters, everybody sing"
I do not think of you
You don't run with the crowd
""
I swear I'd tell you this
"As long as I'm with you, I'm okay"
I am holding you all through the night
Don't care what is written in your history
In a time like this where love comes 'round
"I'd rather die than live without you (I would die, rather die than live without you)"
"Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh"
"Come on now, everybody"
"I played my part, kept you in the dark"
Straight through my heart
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
The perfect fan
To get to you
"Baby, you deserve much better"
And it is telling me
I'd do anything for you
"I, I, know we're gonna take it"
""

Madeleine
"When I look at you, I see something rare"
Ain't nothing but a mistake
"Yeah, yeah, yeah"

Living proof I see myself in you (Oh)
Did our talks get a little bit shorter?
"Everyone, we're standing strong 'cause of what you've done"
Playing in the name of love (love)

"Woah, oh, oh, Madeleine"
"No no no no, yeah yeah yeah"
Voices tell me I should carry on
"(I been standin', waitin', gazin' up)"
Am I everything you need?
Straight through my heart

"Forgive my honesty, but you gotta go"
Now this must come to an end
Who can fall in and out of love with you
"Someone like you, I'd take back all those nights I wasted"
I need you right now
"Was about to go home when there she was, standing in front of me"
Just because I made that call and lied
What you want is what you gon' get
""
""
""
And I can't be hit
"Its 2 A.M., you're not even home, I'm here alone"
If you want to make it last
Anything you want me to
'Cause people change and memories fade
"Sure it wasn't what it was, yeah"
""
To make you mine
But tell me if you feel it too
You still wonder if we made a big mistake
How your love's affecting our reality
"Baby, I want you back (Yeah)"
Get up on this just to get right
"I'ma do whatever it takes (Oh, oh, oh)"
Darling that you'd been hurt
Anywhere you asked me to
"Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby"
Tell me why
It's time for me to let it go
"Everyone, everyone, everyone (oh, oh)"
"I can't compare you to no one else, no one else"
Tell me
"Keeps us alive, yeah"
I loved you from a distance
You keep me drowning in your love
""
"The more I think about how we were, the more that I'm sure"
"Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh"
"Baby, I can't help it"
Who will make all your sorrows undone
"Girl, it's all for you, everything I do"
Am I sexual?
"Like so many times, so many times before"
"No, it's never gonna be the way it was, oh (Ha, ha)"
Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
You know you have got to stop (from my heart)
Now I know why I was born
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
Tell me why cannot I be there where you are?
"From the way that it used to be, yeah"
We've got it goin' on for years
I feel in heaven when I look in your eyes
Can somebody take me back? (Take me back)
"No, no, no"
"Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all (Oh)"
"You're all I need, oh girl"
And it is telling me
"I promise you I will be true, yeah"
Don't want you back
"Oh, yeah"
"With you, I want to spend the rest of my life"
Where Im going is anybodys guess
"Ooh, yeah, ain't no place"
"""Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low"
Even listening to a word you say?
"It keeps getting closer, baby"
Don't want to be alone tonight
Cause only you can Madeleine
""
In a world like this
""
Can you forgive me and open
"I'd rather die than live without you (baby, honey, I'd never)"
"Oh, oh, oh yeah"
But I want it that way
I don't know where to start
I couldn't live my life without you in it
And move it all around
""
""
That's the way I like it
'Cause it's the only one I've got (Yeah)
Don't want you back
"The sun, the stars, the moon"
Why? Get another boyfriend

Wherever you are is home
"First step off of this plane, I knew"
But he'll eat you up from inside slow and then he doesn't wanna know
I'm leaving my life in your hands
You drive me crazy 'cause you're one of a kind
"""Say that again?"""
Now we're minutes away 'til it's time to play
"Baby, it's the way you make me"
""
I want to thank you for that time
The one desire
""
"It's a shot to my veins, lying in your bed"
I want it that way
And be the perfect son
All this space in between us makes it hard to feel close to you (Close to you)
Everybody
"(Yeah I like this, ha ha)"
Life goes on as it never ends
I've got you
Rock your body right
And wonder where the ships would go
No place like you
Quit playin' games with my heart
My sex ain't got no rules

Of a love so loud
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
And I am proud to say you are mine
"Give me one more chance, to give my love to you"
Oh yeah

Looking back on the things I've done

If you could see these tears I'm crying
"Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me, too"
"This isn't how I remember us, no, baby (Ha, ha, ha, ha)"
I like it
Never again
Just how to walk without your hands
"And I call it new love, new love, new love (New love)"
"Your words are a symphony, music that sings to me"
Ha-ha-ha-ha
A helping hand to make it right
It is hard to see in a crimson love
And my heart beats again
Nothing else matters
""
"Forgive my honesty, but you gotta go (Yeah)"
Now all I ask is for a chance
Don't say it's the wrong thing (Don't say it's the wrong thing)
You always say the words I love to hear
In love
"(Yeah, no)"
"I won't say the words, then take them back"

I'm passionate
And there is never a day that passes by
In hopes I can give back to you

"There ain't no place, ain't no place like you"
The words to say
Because I got you
"Baby, it's the way you make me"
When it should've just blown over
"Your every wish will be done, they tell me"
I can't breathe
What we can do for you
I'd go anywhere for you

"Hey, yeah, oh, oh, yeah"
"You are tearing us apart (my heart, my heart)"
"I deserve a try (try) honey, just once (once)"
Without you I don't think I could live
Every time I hold you near
