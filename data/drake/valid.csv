"Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you"
You know me? You know me?
"After all the things that we been through, I got you"
"You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course?compliments of the company?and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last?all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow..."
"I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one"
Hell nah
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
"'Cause I want ya, and I need ya"
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
"Man, you deserve it"
"They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real"
"Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it"
"Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right"
I hope you can take it
"I bought this one a house, I bought this one a mall"
"But girl, we both thought it"
You must really love the road life
"She say, ""Do you love me?"" I tell her, ""Only partly"
"She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (Front)"
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
"Yeah, I know they wanna take my place"
"Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin', huh (ya dig?)"
"I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh"
"I mix, double the cup when I stress"
"Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed"
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
"I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)"
Only over my dead body
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
"End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)"
"Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me"
"(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)"
""
That's real
"Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause they scared to rap, ayy"
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
I'm just sayin' you could do better
"And you know it's King Slime Drizzy, damn (Woo yeah)"
This is more than just a new lust for you
I don't wanna fight it
"Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do"
"I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose"
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
"Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go"
I'm workin' on dyin'
"That was back then, man"
""
"Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga"
"You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl"
"How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?"
I group DM my exes
"My time with you, my"
"Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it"
"We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas"
Just when shit look out of reach
I don't wanna spend time fighting
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
Now you're talkin' my language
"Always haffi look out, yuh no know if yuh head book out"
She just want to smoke and fuck
Everybody knows and I feel left out
"Bring us up, I never take us down"
Miraval to the face though
"They know, they know, they know"
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
"Best believe, she's fucking some niggas on that team"
"I dedicate, I dedicate"
"Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil"
"That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us"
That can only mean one thing
"And since you picked up, I know he's not around"
"This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop"
"I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover"
Knowing I'd lie for you
"Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you"
"Stuck in the house, need to get out more"
They don't need to know all of our business
"I heard your new shit, nigga hated it"
So get your ass in that car and come through
Never let these niggas ride your wave
"Hol' it yute, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it"
I guess thats just the motion
""
"Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say"
They ain't even wanna look up at the score
I got rap niggas that I gotta act like I like
"Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me"
"Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?"
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Is it the strength of your feelings
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
"I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low"
And if somehow you knew
When I come for that shit like O.D.B
"Just hold on, we're going home (going home)"
"Back, up, back up and wine it, girl"
"You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do"
"Baby, cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it"
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
"If you let me, here's what I'll do"
"Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill"
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
"Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month"
I've loved and I've lost
I wanna know who mothafuckin' representin' in here tonight
"Started from the bottom, now we're here"
They keep fallin' apart
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
That's the wrong thing to do
""
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
"I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know.. we know"
I gotta sit back and digest (straight up!)
""
""
"That I'ma call you anyway, and say?"
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
"I love me, I love me enough for the both of us"
"They wanna mash it up, woah"
"Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in"
"And the party's over, just don't forget me"
"Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you"
"Showtime, headlines, big time"
"When you know, you know I'm the same"
You knew that I was gonna be something
"Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino"
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
When he told me pay it no mind
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
"Drake from Canada, Beenie Man from Jamaica"
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
