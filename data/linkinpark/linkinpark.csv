"I dont like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but theres comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I cant escape the gravity

I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

You say that I'm paranoid
But Im pretty sure the world is out to get me
Its not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everythings about me

Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?"
"It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter"
"Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
There are things that we can have, but can't keep

If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

The reminders, pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there

If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

(I do)

Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do
Well I do"
"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you!

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing, too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be"
"I got a long way to go
And a long memory
I been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I been searching for the courage
To face my enemies
When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
Ill fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just dont give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

They say that I dont belong
Say that I should retreat
That Im marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse
When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
Ill fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just dont give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
Ill fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just dont give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony"
"So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

(Wooh!)
Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong

(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoes
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)"
"Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming) Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling) Confusing what is real"
"Tell me what I've gotta do
There's no getting through to you
The lights are on but nobody's home (nobody's home)
You say I can't understand
But you're not giving me a chance
When you leave me, where do you go? (Where do you go?)

All the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you

The truth is, you turn into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself
Talking to myself
Talking to myself
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself

I admit I made mistakes
But yours might cost you everything
Can't you hear me calling you home?

Oh, all the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you

The truth is, you turned into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know

"I'm dancing with my demons
I'm hanging off the edge
Storm clouds gather beneath me
Waves break above my head
Headfirst hallucination

I wanna fall wide awake now
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight

But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
I'm chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

Stared into this illusion
For answers yet to come
I chose a false solution
But nobody proved me wrong
Headfirst hallucination

I wanna fall wide awake
Watch the ground giving way now
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight

But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
I'm chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

Been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here (I wanna fall wide awake now)
I've been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here (I wanna fall wide awake now)
I wanna fall wide awake now
So tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight

And only I can save me now
I'm holding up a light
Chasing out the darkness inside
And I don't wanna let you down
But only I can save me!
Been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here"
"Memories consume, like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime, before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight, again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
Im breaking the habit tonight"
"Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there, for you to see
For you to see

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see, for you to see"
"In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've done

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself

"(When this began) I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Looking everywhere, only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real

"I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared

When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Don't be afraid, I've taken my beating
I've shared what I made
I'm strong on the surface, not all the way through
I've never been perfect but neither have you

So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else
Can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are

When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some, reasons to be missed
Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty

I can't convince you to just believe this is real

So, I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not

Echoes and buzzing noises
I know the words we said
But wish I could've turned our voices down

Only organized confusion
I'm just trying to get it right

I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used

"Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can
But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within

"Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach, somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor, again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out"
"This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them
We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control
Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision
I'm holding on to what I haven't got
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them
We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
Holding on to what I haven't got
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear"
"The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

And you were there, at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground"
"Mama always told me don't you run
""Don't you run with scissors, son
You're gonna hurt someone""
Mama told me look before you leap
Always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

Should've played it safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn't understand
Never could've planned
They made me who I am
Put your nose in paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These are years you're never getting back

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

"Yeah, yo

You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no
I followed, so taken
So conditioned, I could never let go
Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid, I couldn't let myself see
That I could never be held
Back or up, no, I hold myself
Check the rep, yep, you know mine well
Forget the rest, let them know my Hell
There and back, yet my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up, the best they fell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there, saying

In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go, go, go

Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that, frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back, unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
So, you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone
I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there, saying

In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go!

No, you can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how
I don't care where the enemies are
Can't be stopped, all I know, go hard
Won't forget how I got this far
For every time, saying

In these promises broken deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go, go, go
Go, go, go, go"
"Watching the wings cut through the clouds
Watching the raindrops blinking red and white
Thinking of you back on the ground
There with a fire burning in your eyes
I only halfway apologized

And I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse
To go the way we planned
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day
That you will understand
You will understand

After a while you may forget
But just in case the memories cross your mind
You couldn't know this when I left
Under the fire of your angry eyes
I never wanted to say goodbye

So I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse
To go the way we planned
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day
That you will understand
You will understand

Yeah, stop telling 'em to pump the bass up
Tried to call home but nobody could wait up
Switch your time zones can't pick the pace up
I just passed out by the time you wake up
Best things come to those who wait
And it's bound to get rough on any road you take
But don't you ever have a doubt and make no mistake
I can't wait to come back when I'm going away

So I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
(Things we have to do that we can't stand)
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around

You will understand
You will understand

"I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway

Just like before

Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break)

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

Just like before

Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe

"I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
Used to get high with the dead end kids
Abandoned houses where the shadows lived
I never been higher than I was that night
I woke up driving my car
I couldn't see then what I see right now
The road dissolving like an empty vow
Couldn't remember where I'd been that night
I knew I took it too far

All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right (halfway right)

Told me ""Kid, you're going way too fast
You burn too bright, you know you'll never last""
It was bullshit then, I guess it makes sense now
I woke up driving my car
Said I'd lose you if I lost control
I just laughed because what do they know?
Here I am, standing all alone
Because I took it too far

All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right , halfway right

Nana nana, na nana nana
Na na na na na na na na
But I was already gone

I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
Na na na na na na na na
Nana nana, na nana nana

"I close both locks below the window
I close both blinds and turn away
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you

In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you"
"I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
Across this new divide
Across this new divide"
"Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left lone
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain I've known

Give up your heart, left broken
And let that mistake pass on
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
And in time, you'll be glad it's gone

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh

Whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh

Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end, and if you need a friend
There's a seat here alongside me

Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

"I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors and then rapidly
Just turn around and start asking me
About things that you want back from me

I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place, to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

(Maybe someday I'll be just like you and)
Step on people like you do and
Run away the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should've known
That you'd wear out your welcome
And now you see how quiet it is, all alone

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Stay away
I am so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
Stay away from me"
"When you were standing in the wake of devastation
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
And with the cataclysm raining down
Insides crying, ""Save me now""
You were there, impossibly alone

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

And in a burst of light that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace
Falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failures all youve known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go"

"Turn my mic up louder, I got to say something
Lightweights step it aside when we come in
Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumping
People on the street, they panic and start running
Words on loose leaf sheet complete coming
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme I'm dumping
Healing the blind, I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drumming
Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping
Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumping
Risk something, take back what's yours
Say something that you know they might attack you for
'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before
Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor
Like they understand you in the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
And these fuckers are laughing their way to the bank
Cashing the check
Asking you to have compassion and have some respect
For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watching, at the end of the day
In the living room laughing like, ""What did he say?""

Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen
Amen

In my living room watching but I am not laughing
'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen
The world is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react or get blown into fractions
Ten years old, it's something to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
Do you see the soldiers that are out, today?
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up, yesterday
There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine on the back
He hand-wrote a quote, inside
""When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die""
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watching, at the end of the day
Both scared and angry, like ""What did he say?""

Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen
Amen

And now, you think this person really is me
And I'm (Trying to bend the truth)
But the more I push, the more I'm pulling away
'Cause I'm (Lying my way from)

You (No, no turning back, now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back, now)
Let me take back my life
Id rather be all alone (No turning back, now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back, now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me

This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me, like this
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me, like this
(This) This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me, like this
(This) This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said
Would have you running from me, like this

You (No turning back, now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back, now)
Let me take back my life
Id rather be all alone (No turning back, now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back, now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me"
"Tearing me apart with the words you wouldn't say
And suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away
'Cause I don't have a reason and you don't have the time
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade

All I ever wanted, the secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness and you can't see the crime
But we both keep on waiting, for what we left behind

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade
The final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade"
"Waking in sweat again
Another day's been laid to waste, in my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place, there's no escape
I'm my own worst enemy...

I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused but I'm scared, I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help somehow, somewhere and no one cares
I'm my own worst enemy

I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

God!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my
Put me out of my fucking misery!

I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me"
"When you feel you're alone, cut off from this cruel world
Your instincts telling you to run
Listen to your heart, those angel voices
They'll sing to you, they'll be your guide back home

When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
It keeps us kind

When you've suffered enough and your spirit is breaking
You're growing desperate from the fight
Remember you're loved and you always will be
This melody will bring you right back home

When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind"
"I woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
And though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

I'm with you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong, I pretend the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So even though you're close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

It's true the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

I'm with you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I, I can't wait to see tomorrow

With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes"
"It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Something has been taken
From deep inside of me
A secret I've kept locked away
No one can ever see
Wounds so deep, they never show
They never go away
Like moving pictures in my head
For years and years they've played

If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Sometimes, I remember
The darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories
I wish I didn't have
Sometimes, I think of letting go
And never looking back
And never moving forward, so
There'd never be a past

If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

Just washing it aside
All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
Is so much simpler than change

It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

It's easier to run
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made
It's easier to go
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave"
"Come, come, come
Come, coming at you...
Come, coming at you...
Come, coming at you...
Yo...

Peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is: how could you ignore it?
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like ""rewind that""
We're just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten, but still unforgiven
But in the meantime, there are those
Who wanna talk this and that, so I suppose
That it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt
It goes...

Try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
And everything left's a waste of time
I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else's more
I'm riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that it's better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
The uphill struggle over years, the fear
And trash-talking and the people it was to
And the people that started it, just like you

Try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Heart full of pain

Try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Nobody's listening
Handful of anger held in my chest
Nobody's listening
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nobody's listening
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Nobody's listening

Come, come, come, come, coming at you...
Come, coming, come, come, coming at you...
Come, coming, come, come, coming at...
Come, come, come, come
Coming at you from every side"
"What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily fa??ade, but then
I just end up getting hurt again

By myself (Myself) I ask why
(But in my mind, I find) I can't rely on myself

(But in my mind, I find) I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

By myself (Myself) I ask why
(But in my mind, I find) I can't rely on myself
(Myself) I ask why

It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid that I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?

Don't you (Know)
I can't tell you how to make it (Go)
No matter what I do, how hard I (Try)
I can't seem to convince myself (Why)

"Graffiti decorations under a sky of dust
A constant wave of tension on top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me, I learned were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action, these words were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

I'm gonna run away and never say goodbye

We're out of time left to watch it all unwind

"From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

There's a place so dark, you can't see the end
Skies cock back and shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut, looking through the rust and rot
And dust, a small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps
Behind street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

"Nothing ever stops all these thoughts
And the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happening
It's like nothing I could do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
'Cause from the infinite words, I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn't realize, instead of setting it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away
It never goes away

And now, you've become a part of me

You've become a part of me

I can't separate

Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you

Hearing your name, the memories come back again
I remember when it started happening
I'd see you in every thought I had, and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committing myself to them, and everyday
I regret saying those things, 'cause now
I see that I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away
It never goes away

And now, you've become a part of me

You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame

Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of being rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split is nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowing as soon as the dough or the deal peak
They say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain drained, manipulated like artists
It's real deep until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock
Till pop and radio and record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
You feel me, we'll see that green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
TV or a name, the Media, the game, to me you're all the same
You're guilty

You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame

Nor the same person telling you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain
And I found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems
And it seems ugly, but it can get worse
'Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
'Cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first

Rocking every stage in every place that it brought me
I'm awfully underrated
But came here to correct it
And so it ain't mistaken, I'ma state it for the record
I am
The opposite of wack
Opposite of weak
Opposite of slack
Synonym of heat
Synonym of crack
Closest to a peak
Far from a punk

And poured it out in an ocean of debris

Of bridges I have burned

I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

We held our breath when the clouds began to form
But you were lost in the beating of the storm
And in the end, we were made to be apart
Like separate chambers of the human heart

So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
It's in the blackened bones

This is me, alone

(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things
That I said to you

And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

This is my December
These are my snow-covered dreams
This is me pretending
This is all I need

(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things
That I said to you

And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to"
"There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part
You can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
And you've got to make it stop

To save face, how low can you go
Talk a lot of game but yet you don't know
Static on the way, make us all say whoa
The people up top push the people down low
Get down
And obey every word
Steady getting mine if you haven't yet heard
Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd
Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt
If you haven't heard yet then I'm letting you know
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload
And no one make a move unless my people say so
Got everything outta control
Now everybody go

Steel unload, final blow
We the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings we come for you

So keep pace, how slow can you go
Talk a lot of shit and yet you don't know
Fire on the way, make you all say whoa
The people up top and the people down low
Get down
And I'm running it like that
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at
Somewhere in-between, the kick and the hi-hat
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact
So get with the combat, I'm letting 'em know
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down no
So push the button let the whole thing blow
Spinning everything outta control
Now everybody go

Steel unload, final blow
We the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings we come for you
Steel unload, fire blow
Filthy animals, beat them low
Skin and bone, black and blue
No more this sun shall beat onto you

From the front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high

When the operation of the machine becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part
You can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
And you've got to make it stop
And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it
That unless you're free
The machine will be prevented from working at all"
"Water grey
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean, everywhere

Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do

Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares

Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underground
Now I, now I do


The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away

All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away
All you've ever wanted
The little things give you away
Was someone to truly look up to you
The little things give you away"
"I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies, how they cut so deeply
You can't get enough, you take
And take and take and never say

No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run but then back, you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and take and take
Fuck it, are you listening?

No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

Blackout, blood in your eye!
You push it back down! Push it back down!
You push it back down, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!

Floating down, as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paperwhite
And floating up, you pass us in the night
A future gazing out, a past to overwrite
So, come down, far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down, far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh"
"There are just too many
Times that people
Have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you
And I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that Ive
Held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind
Afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that youve said about me when Im not around
You think having the upper hand
Means you gotta keep puttin' me down
But Ive had too many stand-offs with you
Its about as much as I can stand
So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine

One minute, youre on top
(The next youre not
Watch it drop)
Making your heart stop
(Just before you hit the floor)
One minute, youre on top
(The next youre not
Missed your shot)
Making your heart stop
(You think you won)
And then it's all gone

So many people like me
Put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think
To just say what we feel inside
So many people like me
Walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want
Is to feel like Im not stepped on
There are so many things you say
That make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall
And Im counting down the time
'Cause Ive had so many stand-offs with you
Its about as much as I can stand
So Im waiting until the upper hand is mine

One minute, youre on top
(The next youre not
Watch it drop)
Making your heart stop
(Just before you hit the floor)
One minute, youre on top
(The next youre not
Missed your shot)
Making your heart stop
(You think you won)
And then it's all gone

And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
Now it's all gone

I know Ill never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide use, but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall

One minute, youre on top
(The next youre not
Watch it drop)
Making your heart stop
(Just before you hit the floor)
One minute, youre on top
(The next youre not
Missed your shot)
Making your heart stop
(You think you won)
And then it's all gone

And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
And then, it's all gone
Now it's all gone"
"Separate
Sifting through the wreckage, I can't concentrate
Searching for a message in that fear and pain
Broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

Come apart
Falling in the cracks of every broken heart
Digging through the wreckage of your disregard
Sinking down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one

Now, in my remains (One by one, one by one)
Are promises that never came (One by one by one)
Set this silence free (One by one, one by one)
To wash away the worst of me (One by one by one)

Like an army falling (One by one, one by one)
One by one by one (One by one by one)
Like an army falling (One by one, one by one)
One by one by one"
"My insides all turned to ash, so slow
And blew away as I collapsed, so cold
A black wind took them away from sight
And held the darkness over day, that night
And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

I used to be my own protection, but not now
'Cause my path has lost direction, somehow
A black wind took you away from sight
And held the darkness over day, that night
And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder
As they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

So now, you're gone and I was wrong
I never knew what it was like to be alone

On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
(I used to be my own protection, but not now)
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
('Cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
(I used to be my own protection, but not now)
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
('Cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)"
"A fire needs a space to burn
A breath to build a glow
I've heard it said a thousand times
But now I know

That you don't know what you've got
Oh, you don't know what you've got
No, you don't know what you've got
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

I thought I kept you safe and sound
I thought I made you strong
But something made me realize
That I was wrong
'Cause finding what you've got sometimes
Means finding it alone
And I can finally see your light
When I let go

'Cause you don't know what you've got
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

'Cause you don't know what you've got
Oh, you don't know what you've got
No, you don't know what you've got
It's your battle to be fought
No, you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
."
"Yeah
Uh

So what'cha waiting for, anticipating more
While you debate what it could take to instigate a war?
Yeah, I been hated more than time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fucking say they didn't say before
But you could never see it, your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe, but this is take a shot time
While you're waiting for a purpose, I already got mine
While you tell me step to it like ""one, two, three, four""

And if I do what you demand
(You say!) You'll let me understand
(You say!) You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
(You say!) I'll have no debt to pay
(You say!) I'm gonna get what I deserve

Your word, obeyed
My debt, repaid
Our trust, betrayed
All for nothing! All for nothing!

Kick back, there's no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for you, I really don't know you
You talk, but let me show you where to put your paranoia
You're joking, I don't have a half a sucker bone to throw you
I'm disgusted
Wonder what could've made you tuck your tail below you
And no, I'm not your soldier, I'm not taking any orders
I'm a five-star general infantry controller
Need a lesson? Let me show you
Have you checking your composure
While I make you step to it like ""one, two, three, four""?

And if I do what you demand
(You say!) You'll let me understand
(You say!) You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
(You say!) I'll have no debt to pay
(You say!) I'm gonna get what I deserve

And if I do what you demand
You'll let me understand

Your word, obeyed
My debt, repaid
Our trust, betrayed
All for nothing! All for nothing!
All for nothing! All for nothing!

 ?We're (going?) too far
 ?I don't think we're too far
 ?We are
 ?There's a difference. Put the heavy shit there
 ?The heavy shit right here?"
