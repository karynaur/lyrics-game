Replacing this pain with something numb
""
Was someone to truly look up to you
"Live from the rhythm, it's"
"Oh, like memories in cold decay"
"For once, just to hear me out"
"Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored"
Shut up when I'm talking to you
I woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
""
"Risk something, take back what's yours"
""
""
The machine will be prevented from working at all
Switch your time zones can't pick the pace up
""
Making your heart stop
""
"Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow"
'Cause Ive had so many stand-offs with you
There's only one thing you should know
I wanna run away and open up my mind
""
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
You live what you've learned
What it meant to me will eventually
Escuch??nme todos
Each word gets lost in the echo
Transmissions echoing away
Flying at the speed of light
Good goodbye
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
""
Need to be alone
All the walls that you keep building
I just passed out by the time you wake up
""
Chilling rain
Cock it back and then watch it go
It's so much easier to go
(Don't you come back no more)
I'm my own worst enemy...
""
"Show us all again, that our hands are unclean"
Replacing this pain with something numb
"You try to take the best of me, go away"
"You take away, when I give in"
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Let me take back my life
""
"Come, coming at you..."
""
"Back or up, no, I hold myself"
(And I) Take back all the things I said
God bless us everyone
"At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)"
I've got an aching head
Somewhere I belong
The darkness holding me tightly
And say what I don't mean
""
Push it back down! You push it back down!
""
And I drive myself crazy
That I get what I deserve
""
""
Separate
Walk on eggshells all day long
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
"And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair"
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening
That it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
Waiting to let me know
Why is everything so heavy?
I can't feel the way I did before
Talking to myself
There are no clear solutions
Lauryn said money change a situation
Nor the same person telling you to forfeit the game
Pretending someone else
God bless us everyone
I hear my battle symphony
"I wanna heal, I wanna feel"
God bless us everyone
""
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
Amen
""
""
Used to be generous but you should've known
"No surrender, no illusions"
I bleed it out
Battle symphony
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
""
I thought I kept you safe and sound
""
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Where oceans bleed into the sky!
Forgiving what I've done
""
The sun will set for you
""
"On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day"
"And the people that started it, just like you"
"Has fallen apart, right in front of you"
All you've ever wanted
"The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em"
"(No, no turning back, now)"
""
That you will understand
And I'm running it like that
But memories left abandoned
I don't want to be the one
"And in time, you'll be glad it's gone"
 ?We are
Nobody's listening
Tell us all again how to do what you say
Need to remember just to breathe
""
"Now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back"
"I wanna heal, I wanna feel"
No matter how far we've come
And obey every word
Or why I have to scream
Wishing I had strength to stand
Are promises that never came
Love keeps us kind
I wanna fall wide awake now
""
"Lift me up, let me go"
Put me out of my misery!
"I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else's more"
And how trying to put my trust in you
"Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest"
So don't apologize
This is my time of the year
"Sharp edges have consequences, now"
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
I wasted it all just to watch you go
"And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it"
""
(And watches everything)
'Cause I cant escape the gravity
And I believed when you told that lie
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies
"One thing, I don't know why"
I've lied to you
So say goodbye and hit the road
No! You'll never get it inside!
"They'll sing to you, they'll be your guide back home"
""
And I can finally see your light
Wonder what could've made you tuck your tail below you
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
The sacrifice is never knowing
(This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
"Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
"I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)"
Everything you say to me
""
The sins of our father
""
""
"Come, come, come, come"
To cross out what I've become
No! You'll never get it inside!
"Wings up, now I'm airborne"
You won't find an equivalent
To prove me wrong
"There's a place so dark, you can't see the end"
Good goodbye
""
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
""
As a nation simply stares
"Become so tired, so much more aware"
Say your prayers and stomp it out
This is the last time
For what's been missing right here
I got a long way to go
(Don't you come back no more)
Turn your back like you always do
"Gonna run away, gonna run away"
""
"No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me"
Of bridges I have burned
I'm about to break)
"Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme"
"Our trust, betrayed"
""
What I thought was never real
"Lift me up, let me go"
I can't wait to come back when I'm going away
And when I close my eyes tonight
And I know that I won't be satisfied
And this is how it ends
But don't you ever have a doubt and make no mistake
And if I sell myself away
What I've done
Used to get high with the dead end kids
I don't know how I got this way
""
You'll let me understand
Making your heart stop
A face that laughs every time they fall
All you've ever wanted
We live somehow
You want to share what you have been through
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening
"You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears"
So don't apologize
But wish I could've turned our voices down
"I wanna run away, never say goodbye"
"Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this"
We all fall down
""
Nobody's listening
Watching the raindrops blinking red and white
""
"Now, in my remains"
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
Without a sense of confidence
'Cause you don't know what you've got
"I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away"
The battles always choose
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
"You knew your lies would divide use, but you lied anyway"
"Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs"
The sins of our young? No!
Na na na na na na na na
I don't know why I instigate
Like an army falling one by one by one
The cycle repeated
You've become a part of me
Was someone to truly look up to you
Is be more like me and be less like you
"I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed"
For bridges I have burned
You like to think you're never wrong (Forfeit the game)
"Sometimes, I think of letting go"
""
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
"Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
"I can't feel the way I did, before"
"And let it go, let it go"
""
This is me pretending
I hear my battle symphony
It can't be outmatched
I tried so hard and got so far
Confusing what is real
That I get what I deserve
So many people like me
""
The very worst part of you is me
Remember all the sadness and frustration
"Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said"
It can't be outdone
Till pop and radio and record companies killed me
It never goes away
And I found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems
"'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can"
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I'm just talking to myself
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
""
""
"I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away"
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
"Lift me up, let me go"
The little things give you away
Need you to stay away from me
"I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger"
The little things give you away
""
Too many times that Ive
It's all too much to take in
These are my snow-covered dreams
""
It never goes away
I was too scared to say out loud
So don't apologize
Been searching somewhere out there
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
And I'm (Trying to bend the truth)
Steady getting mine if you haven't yet heard
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Let the bells ring wherever they are
""
I'm holding on
I can't separate
Let the rest be the tale they tell
The little things give you away
"Would have you running from me, like this"
I would take all my shame to the grave
Who cares if one more light goes out?
The darkness holding me tightly
The sins of our tongue
You have to act like you're someone
I won't trust myself with you
You have to act like you're someone
"You can't get enough, you take"
"Lift me up, let me go"
"Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored"
I've never been perfect but neither have you
Don't you (Know)
What goes up will surely fall
I cannot take this anymore
Get down
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
I never thought that what I said
"Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me"
"I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger"
Forgot all about yesterday
You better have some place to go
If they say
I'm just trying to get it right
Holding on
I just end up getting hurt again
Digging through the wreckage of your disregard
"And it seems ugly, but it can get worse"
I'll pick you up right off the ground
"You feel me, we'll see that green could be to blame or greedy for the fame"
"Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said"
""
And I was there at the turn
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
"I've let you go, so get away from me"
"I can whisper, I can yell"
You like to think you're never wrong
So say goodbye and hit the road
""
"Steel unload, fire blow"
You think having the upper hand
To wash away the worst of me (One by one by one)
(Na-na na na)
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
There's no one else to blame
"Sometimes, I remember"
We're building it up to break it back down
Alone with a sinking feeling
"Ten years old, it's something to see"
"Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus"
There's no getting through to you
I'm with you
I'm my own worst enemy
If I cannot break your fall

Headfirst hallucination
Did you care for him?
You live what you've learned
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again
(Don't you come back no more)
"(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back"
Each word gets lost in the echo
"Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would"
I wanna fall wide awake
The road dissolving like an empty vow
When you can't put gas in your tank
"Escuch??nme, preste atenci??n"
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
"One minute, youre on top"
And it can't be outfought
"Nana nana, na nana nana"
""
I need a little room to breathe
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
(You say!) I'm gonna get what I deserve
What I've done
"Sharp edges have consequences, now"
"Go, go, go, go"
Guilty by association
Though the words sound steady
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
"Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear"
Of bridges I have burned
It's easier to run
"You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed"
"('Cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)"
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
This is my December
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
Mama always told me don't you run
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
"Would have you running from me, like this"
Big said it increase the complication
That Im marching to the rhythm
So Im waiting until the upper hand is mine
Guilty all the same
I don't want to be the one
So don't apologize

Front to the back and the side to side
Weep not for roads untraveled
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
But nobody can save me now
""
It's so much easier to go
"Showin' out, she in rare form"
And you can't understand the fact
Across this new divide
"And now, you've become a part of me"
You say that it's not your fault
Handful of anger held in my chest
Goodbye to the stereotypes
"A future gazing out, a past to overwrite"
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
""
""
Front to the back and the side to side
With you
"All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty"
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
For all this
"And even though I tried, it all fell apart"
Over and over again
I hyperventilate
Watching the wings cut through the clouds
And you were there at the turn
And swear that I am mistaken
I try to catch my breath again
"And then, it's all gone"
With you
"(But in my mind, I find) I can't rely on myself"
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
"So now, you're gone and I was wrong"
Don't stay
""
"I've felt this way before, so insecure"
That unless you're free
"You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame"
"Like an army falling (One by one, one by one)"
""
""
"Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way"
"Nothing to gain, everything to fear"
You said it's not what it seems
"The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact"
"Forcefully, the power of suggestion"
In cards and flowers on your window
"What I don't deserve, oh"
What you were changing me into
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
Talking to myself
"The blame is mine, alone"
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor
Take all your faithlessness with you
(You say!) You'll let me understand
""
""
And in a burst of light that blinded every angel
'Cause nobody can save me
With you
Is there nothing you can say?
Looking so dissatisfied
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
All for nothing! All for nothing!
"Just to throw it away, just to throw it away"
"Come for me, I'll be gone"
This is not what I had planned
Or why I have to scream
To have someone to come home to
"I wanna know the answers, no more lies"
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
All you said to do was slow down
"To save face, how low can you go"
"Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface"
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Until it's gone
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
"Don't want to reach for me, do you?"
A constant wave of tension on top of broken trust
I remembered each flash
The levees are breaking
You have to act like you're someone (Forfeit the game)
Talking to myself
As explosions broke in the sky
Sometimes goodbye's the only way
To have someone to come home to
I'll paint it on the walls
"So, one last lie I can see through"
""
To cross out what I've become
You've become a part of me

You better have some place to go
This isn't what I wanted to be
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
"Shotgun opera, lock and load"
"We the animals, take control"
"Cover up your face, you can't run the race"
With you
"Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way"
It starts with one
With you
"If I turn my back, I'm defenseless"
Fear is how I fall
"Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow"
"I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy"
"No, no matter how far we've come"
""
Like an army falling one by one by one
"Filthy animals, beat them low"
"Try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me"
"You try to take the best of me, go away"
As they put you down inside
"If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now"
"In these promises broken, deep below"
Is there nothing you can say?
Erase myself
"Can't contain him, he knows he works"
(Don't you come back no more)
Until it's gone
"'Cause my path has lost direction, somehow"
"When you leave me, where do you go? (Where do you go?)"
"Set this silence free (One by one, one by one)"
"Mama, help me, I've been cursed"
"Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me"
The sun goes down
"Looking for help somehow, somewhere and no one cares"
Sometimes things refuse
You want someone to hurt like you
There are no clear solutions
"Always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep"
So say goodbye and hit the road

We're a broken people living under loaded gun
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
The colors conflicted
All the world in front of me

With hands held high into a sky so blue
In disbelief I didn't know

"I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger"
When life leaves us blind
Stared into this illusion

Broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive
But you're not giving me a chance

Crawling in my skin

"It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you"
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
And no one make a move unless my people say so
This is all so clear
Then the shock when you flip it on me
Retrace every wrong move that I made
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Was promised by your face
I've let myself become you
'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before
Don't stay
"If I just let go, I'd be set free"
They never go away
And my eyes are wide awake
Why am I so uptight today?
You
""
I can't separate
A little taste of hypocrisy
"Blackout, blood in your eye!"
You keep running like the sky is falling
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
Pushed as far as I can go
"Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt"
"So, I let go, watching you"
""
""
And let go of what I've done
"It flickers, flickers"
That I couldn't be around
""
"If I could stand up and take the blame, I would"
"Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way"
It keeps us kind
Let the floods cross
""
You push it back down! You push it back down!
"From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)"
"Just to throw it away, just to throw it away"
"So, I'm breaking the habit"
And I'd give it all away
With you
"You, now I see, keeping everything inside"
You want to share what you have been through
""
""
""
Holding on to what I haven't got
Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
""
"I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away"
Warm me up in a nova's glow
There's nothing they can fucking say they didn't say before
"One minute, youre on top"
For what I've done
And take and take and take and take
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
Put to rest what you thought of me
Until it's gone
I know I'm not the center of the universe
And though the words sound steady
I had no options left again
""
"For you to see, for you to see"
The people up top and the people down low
""
""
"Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh"
Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of dust
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
The blood of innocence burning in the skies
"Remember listening to all of that and this, again"
Good goodbye
"So, if you're asking me, I want you to know"
"I'm becoming this, all I want to do"
"I've felt this way before, so insecure"
But couldn't stop from tearing it down
"I make the right moves, but I'm lost within"
All this time that I spent chasing
"Oh, when they come for me"
Under the fire of your angry eyes
"It flickers, flickers"
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind
""
Good goodbye
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Pack it up and disappear
Making your heart stop
I'm just trying to get it right
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
All I know
That I couldn't be around
"May your love never end, and if you need a friend"
"Anything if it's more to gain drained, manipulated like artists"
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind
"You build up hope, but failure's all you've known"
""
Feel like I trusted you too well
""
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
"Now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back"
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
"Now I, now I do"
All of the helplessness inside
The words that I could've used
""
Fear is how I fall
If they say
To fill this hole
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
When all I know is what you tell me to?
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
To wash this memory clean
"Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there"
"I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress"
""
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps
Words on loose leaf sheet complete coming
Just washing it aside
(Na-na na na)
I'm chasing out the darkness inside
"If I let them go, I'll be outdone"
With hands held high into a sky so blue
And when I close my eyes tonight
A black wind took you away from sight
""
"Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight"
Everyone feels so far away from me
Until the sun rises up
Hardly anything there for you to see
And I'd give it all away
'Cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
 ?The heavy shit right here?
With no apologies
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
Remember all the sadness and frustration
Transmissions echoing away
A period is after every sentence
"Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears"
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
"But in the end, it doesn't even matter"
You kept everything inside
Hand grenade pins in every line
I wanna run away and open up my mind
We're building it up to burn it down
Painted on my memories
"Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh"
""
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
I've let myself become you
"I don't hold back, I hold my own"
It's your battle to be fought
If my armor breaks
""
I feel the light betray me
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Bring me home in a blinding dream
I'll never be alright
Till it's gone
Across this new divide
(And I) Take back all the things I said
I took what I hated and made it a part of me
God bless us everyone
To have someone to come home to
I'm losing what I don't deserve
Something has been taken
""
"This time, I finally let you go, go, go"
There'd never be a past
Searching for a message in that fear and pain
"And the rest of the world watching, at the end of the day"
(Just give me myself back and)
"When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again"
To make you feel like that
""
It's easier to run
You better have some place to go
""
It's easier to run
"Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored"
""
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
Watch the time go right out the window
Without a sense of confidence
Waiting to let you know
We live somehow
But came here to correct it
You want someone to hurt like you (Forfeit the game)
Sometimes I
Waiting to let me know
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Took her back to my tinted windows
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
We're all out of time
I hate when you say you don't understand
This is my December
"Everything has to end, you'll soon find"
Like an army falling one by one by one
Something empty's within them
I know I'm not the center of the universe
Means finding it alone
"Less I hear, the less you'll say"
And these fuckers are laughing their way to the bank
"Cover up your face, you can't run the race"
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
Amen
To symphonies of blinding light!
To prove me wrong
When you've suffered enough and your spirit is breaking
"So, I'm breaking the habit"

Front to the back and the side to side

Asking you to have compassion and have some respect
"I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned"
You've learned to hide so well
Until it's gone

"Come for me, I'll be gone"
Show us all again 'cause we cannot be saved

Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
And a long memory
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
Wish that I could slow things down
Fear is how I fall
Pick myself up off the ground
""
"In the memory, you'll find me"
Holding on to what I haven't got
Painted on my memories
"We said it was forever, but then it slipped away"
I built you up but you let me down
"So, one last lie I can see through"
Even if you're not with me
""
"I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right"
All you've ever wanted
"Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door"
"People on the street, they panic and start running"
But I know what I can't stand
Remember all the sadness and frustration
"I've become so numb, I can't feel you there"
Everything you say to me
Escuch??nme ahora mismo
A place for my head
"No, you don't know what you've got"
"Come, come, come"
"Lift me up, let me go"
Like I'm close to something real
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
You say I can't understand
""
""
""
"From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)"
To just say what we feel inside
Is be more like me and be less like you

Blood on the floor
"You build up hope, but failures all youve known"
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening
I don't need you anymore
But what goes up has got to fall
They say that I dont belong
With someone disappointed in you
"But didn't realize, instead of setting it free"
I tried so hard and got so far
"I, I can't wait to see tomorrow"
"But in the end, it doesn't even matter"
"You try to take the best of me, go away"

Opposite of lazy - far from a punk
They point the finger at me again

You have to act like you're someone
Good goodbye
"When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am"

Don't stay
"Invisible, invisible"
And the clouds above move closer
Have to react or get blown into fractions
All the world in front of me
You live what you've learned
I bleed it out
Connect this space between
I don't know what's worth fighting for
"You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed"
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep

Instead of smoking cigarettes
"Truth is, you can stop and stare"
Lightweights step it aside when we come in

Now I see your testing me pushes me away
The distance in your eyes
"And so it ain't mistaken, I'ma state it for the record"
It's the worst kind of pain I've known
(I) Take everything from the inside
You're guilty
(You'll always be my fear)
And you just want to know you're being heard
And let go of what I've done
Hardly anything there for you to see
This is all so clear

Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame

Na na na na na na na na

Watch it drop)
The lightning all around me
"Goodbye, good riddance"
"I wanna run away, never say goodbye"
Can come and save me from myself
Can come and save me from myself
I'm stuck on the outside
And all the people say
It can't be outdone
"I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared"
The same way that I always do

Of you wasting me away
"'Cause I swear, for the last time"
"I've kept it in, but now I'm letting you (Know)"
We held our breath when the clouds began to form
'Cause you can't come back around here
I've been searching somewhere out there
For all this

"Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me"
"But oh, we all know"
This is my December
"('Cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)"
But everybody has a face that they hold inside
"Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact"
Till it's gone
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
I find the answers aren't so clear
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
There will be a day that you will understand
Now I find myself in question
"If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would"
I've heard it said a thousand times
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload
"I remember, now I remember"

"With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade"
"You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed"
"(I used to be my own protection, but not now)"
The lights are on but nobody's home (nobody's home)
"If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now"
Handful of anger held in my chest
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You will understand
"At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)"
Put me out of my fucking misery!
"You talk, but let me show you where to put your paranoia"
"Oh, when they come for me"
Don't stay
I find bliss in ignorance
"'Cause I swear, for the last time"
You couldn't know this when I left

"So, if you're asking me, I want you to know"
But no one would listen 'cause no one else cared

The darkness holding me tightly
"I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right"
This is my snow-covered home
Guilty by association
And then it's all gone

"Invisible, invisible"
"Oh, like memories in cold decay"
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind
"And now, you think this person really is me"
"I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away"

This is how we find how it all unwinds
Doesn't matter how hard I try
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
I find bliss in ignorance
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Like goodbye to my old hoes
Guess that I had to find out for myself
"TV or a name, the Media, the game, to me you're all the same"
"Healing the blind, I promise to let the sun in"

"If I could stand up and take the blame, I would"

"You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed"
Fly me up on a silver wing
And I drive myself crazy
For my battle symphony
"Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?"
All these thoughts they make no sense
Everything from the inside
With hands held high into a sky so blue
Controlling) Confusing what is real
It's easier to run
The little things give you away
"Make it a dirt dance floor, again"
Been searching somewhere out there
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

With thoughts of failure sinking
"Take this all away, I'm suffocating"
Put me out of my misery!
Why is everything so heavy?
And suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away
There's a seat here alongside me
"You, now I see, even when I close my eyes"
The sound of your voice
I kept everything inside
Across this new divide

These wounds they will not heal
For answers yet to come
"If I could stand up and take the blame, I would"
I'm disgusted
"The uphill struggle over years, the fear"
Washed away
Find another place to feed your greed
(Things we have to do that we can't stand)
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back
"Come down, oh"
I wanna run away and open up my mind
For my battle symphony
"Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow"
All you said to do was slow down
Everything comes down to memories of (You)
"Longer than you've been alive, you idiot"
By myself (Myself) I ask why

I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
"Blackout, blood in your eye!"
All the walls that you keep building
"Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh"
"But, I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay"
Forget our memories
Trying to forget the past

And the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
"I put on my daily fa??ade, but then"

Giving up a part of me
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
You
The smoke screen before the flame
"You've got a face on the inside, too"
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
String me up from atop these roofs
No more this sun shall beat onto you

Graffiti decorations under a sky of dust

All the ways that I keep losing you
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Heart full of pain
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be

"Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know"
"While I make you step to it like ""one, two, three, four""?"
"From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)"
I need a little room to breathe
To remind myself how I tried so hard
"That we're unprepared, that you have what we need"
"Come, coming, come, come, coming at you..."
"With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade"
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
""
"Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh"
Is so much simpler than change
The final masquerade
Like there was something I missed
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
"If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would"
"Yeah, I been hated more than time I wasn't hated for"
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why
Until it's gone
Said I'd lose you if I lost control
And each regret and each goodbye
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
I hate when you say you don't understand
"Now, in my remains"
"Who wanna talk this and that, so I suppose"
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
Abandoned houses where the shadows lived
""
"Come for me, I'll be gone"
So let mercy come and wash away
You want someone to hurt like you
Somewhere I belong
Right underneath my skin
In the sky of a million stars
"Consuming, confusing"
Heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me
(You'll always be right here)
I won't trust myself with you
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow
(I feel the light betray me)
The sound of your voice
When I let go
Say that I should retreat
A place for my head
So I'll be sorry for now
It can't be outdone
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
This isn't what I wanted to be
I wanted to fix this
Forget our memories
'Cause I can't see forgiveness and you can't see the crime
"(But in my mind, I find) I can't rely on myself"
""
It makes me think of how you act to me
What I've done
"Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumping"
Sometimes goodbye's the only way
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
You're all looking highly illiterate
The very worst part of you is me
Just like before
(Na-na na na)
(The next youre not
Suffocate in the mess you're making
In these promises broken deep below
All the world in front of me
The darkness of my past
I've pulled myself so far
We live somehow
Good goodbye
In the sky of a million stars
Let the floods cross
The little things give you away
Well I do
I'm picking me apart again
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
"But, it's like no matter what I do"
And how trying to put my trust in you
"For every time, saying"
And if I do what you demand
To wash this memory clean
"I was committing myself to them, and everyday"
""
Let it go
I remember back then who you were
I'm stuck on the outside
There was nowhere to hide
Holding on to what I haven't got
"I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away"
The little things give you away

Don't stay
Like moving pictures in my head
"Come down, oh"
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down no
Enemies trying to read me

"I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right"
"Come down, oh"

The darkness holding me tightly
I was too scared to say out loud
The little things give you away
"In the memory, you'll find me"
God save us everyone
I start again
(Just before you hit the floor)
Something in here's not right today
To have a voice in the back of my head
Shut up
So tell me it's alright
""
Where oceans bleed into the sky!
"Dirty money scheme, a clean split is nonsense"
So even though you're close to me
You've got a lot to say
""
Face away and pretend that I'm not
"This time, I finally let you go, go, go"
If a moment is all we are
You push it back down! You push it back down!
The sins of our young? No!
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high
"I played soldier, you played king"
"Told me ""Kid, you're going way too fast"
After a while you may forget
"I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go"
"(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone"
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drumming
"It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back"
I only halfway apologized
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
""
I'm with you
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(This) This isn't what I wanted to be
"I don't back up, I don't back down"
"Become so tired, so much more aware"
"Come down, oh"
"(I used to be my own protection, but not now)"
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer
""
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
Just takes so much out of me
So don't apologize
I admit I made mistakes
I know how it feels to lie
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
"There and back, yet my soul ain't sell"
Shut up
Chuck said that Uzi weigh a motherfucking ton
I'm forgiving what I've done
"But, I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got"
Leave out all the rest
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
"You push it back down, blood in your eye!"
"On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day"
There are so many things you say
Until it's gone
With hands held high into a sky so blue
"We the animals, take control"
Na na na na na na na na
(The next youre not
If my armor breaks
This is not black and white
Time won't heal

We all fall down
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
You will understand

"You were there, impossibly alone"
Leave out all the rest
Like there was something I missed
I need a little room to breathe
And though you're so close to me
You live what you've learned
""
"You build up hope, but failure's all you've known"
You
Too many things that youve said about me when Im not around
I was not mad at you
Goodbye to the cold roads
I am a little bit insecure
"The truth is, you turn into someone else"
""
(Just before you hit the floor)
"Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored"
What I thought was never real
"Turn my mic up louder, I got to say something"
You live what you've learned
Transmissions echoing away
"'Cause I swear, for the last time"
What was left when that fire was gone?
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
It can't be outmatched
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
No! You've gotta get it inside!
The ashes fell like snow
"Hardly anything there, for you to see"
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
"Come down, oh"
"I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong"
"I will not dance, even if the beat's funky"
"Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
"Inside your market, your shops, your clothes"
""
"I've seen that, frustration"
That fate had finally found me
"Lift me up, let me go"
No one there to catch you in their arms
To cross out what I've become
"Controlling, I can't seem"
Tell me what I've gotta do
""
And all the people say
""
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind
All caught up in the eye of the storm
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
They made me who I am
""
"Your word, obeyed"
"The lessons that you taught me, I learned were never true"
"Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way"
""
"Dug the trench out, laid down there"
"It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray"
God save us everyone
"But in the end, it doesn't even matter"
""
That I was wrong
Every scar is a story I can tell
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
"When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done"
"Amen, Amen"
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
We're building it up to break it back down
"If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would"
I wish I didn't have
You live what you've learned
Sometimes I
"Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection"
I know what it takes to move on
"Time won't heal this damage, anymore"
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
"If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would"
You live what you've learned
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high
Thoughts were spinning in my head
For you to see
Till it's gone
And I still keep raising the bar like
But I know you were just like me
"I wanna heal, I wanna feel"
Can't you hear me calling you home?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?

All you've ever wanted

I used the deadwood to make the fire rise

I saw through the words you said
The little things give you away
"Take this all away, I'm suffocating"
Death is rolling in every verse
Need a lesson? Let me show you
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
It's all too much to take in
Was someone to truly look up to you
Good goodbye
"My life, my pride is broken"
"I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away"
As the ocean opens up to swallow you
You live what you've learned
"But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing"
I dont like my mind right now
Forget our memories
All you've ever wanted
So much more than I can carry

Find another place to feed your greed
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
"When you fall, I'll take my turn"
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Points out all my mistakes to me
"You (No, no turning back, now)"
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
Afraid to say what I need to say
"Now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back"
Coming at you from every side
Every scar is a story I can tell
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
All the ways that I keep losing you
And to go blindly seems senseless
Just takes so much out of me

I've let myself become you

Far from the world of you and I

Guilty all the same
Today this ends

That you will understand

"Trying not to break, but I'm so tired of this deceit"
Now I see your testing me pushes me away

"Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh"
"Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow"

We're building it up to break it back down
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
For my battle symphony
When life leaves us blind
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Opposite of slack
I'm chasing out the darkness inside

"Fuck it, are you listening?"
I hear my battle symphony
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer

Fear is how I fall

Afraid to say what was on my mind
With thoughts of failure sinking in
There are things we have to do that we can't stand

And let that mistake pass on
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
"And I've come back, unshaken"
I've shared what I made
Waves break above my head

"Kane said ""Don't step. I ain't the one."""

By myself (Myself) I ask why

The sacrifice is never knowing

'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
Sometimes I wonder why this is happening
And the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
When the operation of the machine becomes so odious
"Stealing second after second, just 'cause I know I can"
And in spite of all I should've done
What I don't deserve
Far from the world of you and I
Pretending I don't feel misplaced

All you've ever wanted
Talk a lot of game but yet you don't know

Mama told me look before you leap

Forgetting all the hurt inside
Good goodbye

I'm telling you that I see it right through you
I want to be in another place
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown

Synonym of heat
In this farewell
Shining with the light from the sun

And then it's all gone

Erase myself

"The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you"
How do you expect I will know what to do
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Guess that I had to find out for myself
But you were lost in the beating of the storm
Oh I'll be sorry for now
Guilty all the same

(You'll always be right here)
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I don't know what stressed me first
"It can't be outrun, no!"
"So hollow, so vicious"
Confusing what is real
"You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame"
What I don't deserve
And everything left's a waste of time

"Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said"
We look up from the ground in fields of paperwhite
"Hearing your name, the memories come back again"

It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
"And six feet underwater, I do"
I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
I've put my trust in you
"This is me, alone"
(And watches everything)
Until it's gone
Yeah
And let it go
Try to force me to stray and obey
Who cares if one more light goes out?
"I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go"
(You think you won)
"Id rather be all alone (No turning back, now)"
'Cause you can't come back around here
And I'm about to break)
Give it all away
"The truth is, you turned into someone else"
Sirens repeat
Take me down to the river bend
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Spinning everything outta control
I hit you and you hit me back

The face inside is right beneath your skin
"The pace is too fast, you just won't last"
""
No! You'll never get it inside!
How do you think I've lost so much?
I know how it feels to lie
Something empty's within them
Have you checking your composure
"I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away"
Fine line between this and that
(This) This isn't what I wanted to be
You live what you've learned
"I'm becoming this, all I want to do"

And poured it out in an ocean of debris
"So what'cha waiting for, anticipating more"
""
Of you wasting me away
"Now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back"
Yeah
A fire needs a space to burn
I'll face myself
I know it's not alright
"Filthy mouth, no excuse"
That I could never be held

But nobody can save me now
We live somehow
Well I do
"But the more I push, the more I'm pulling away"
But this is not black and white
The little things give you away
The distance in your eyes

Please just dont give up on me
Why is everything so heavy?
"Sharp edges have consequences, now"
Rocking every stage in every place that it brought me
Talk a lot of shit and yet you don't know

And trash-talking and the people it was to
A black wind took them away from sight

Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Somewhere I belong
Good goodbye
"Skin and bone, black and blue"
"In the memory, you'll find me"
"But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know"
I'm breaking the habit tonight
So much more than I can carry
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause you don't know what you've got
"Hear us now, clear and true"
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Just feel like screaming at myself
Was someone to truly look up to you
I can't be who you are
"Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!"
If I cannot break your fall
Like there was something I missed
Give it all away
Forgetting all the hurt inside
"In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh"
One by one by one (One by one by one)
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
So give me reason

These are years you're never getting back

Waiting for the end to come
"If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now"
"But, I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got"
"At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience"
"Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty"
Ill fuse it back together
"Whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh"

Holding on
From the truth of a thousand lies
Im breaking the habit tonight
What I don't deserve
"From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)"
"You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame"
(Don't you come back no more)
I'm hanging off the edge
We're building it up to burn it down
"I've kept it in, but now I'm letting you (Know)"
Headed back where you're from

I thought I made you strong
I'm about to break)
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
I'll face myself

With hands held high into a sky so blue
And I've got nothing to say
"I'm not a criminal, not a role model"

"Lift me up, let me go"
That I couldn't be around
I am a little bit of loneliness
"Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way"

"One minute, youre on top"
Forget our memories
"How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?"
No one can ever see
"I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)"
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
"Here I am, standing all alone"
Than face all this pain here all alone
Where oceans bleed into the sky!
Talking to myself
For the sins of our hand
I am not the fortune and the fame
What I don't deserve
And now there will be no mistaking
Are promises that never came
"But sometimes, I don't make sense"
Falling into empty space
Put me out of my
"I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right (halfway right)"
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
Uh
"Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would"
Like they understand you in the back of the jet
"I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away"
Eyes burning up
Forget our possibilities
Take me down to the fighting end
You better have some place to go
Take all your faithlessness with you
And with the cataclysm raining down
And every second I waste is more than I can take
Front to the back and the side to side
You want to share what you have been through
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
Puts the pain in reverse

"My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know"
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel

Shut up
Shut up
And I'm about to)
"And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react"
Remember you're loved and you always will be
"All the lies, how they cut so deeply"
"Our trust, betrayed"
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
And I don't wanna let you down

Please just dont give up on me

Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
Forget our possibilities
"Steel unload, final blow"
What you were changing me into

"Behind street lamps, chain-link, and concrete"
Bringing back these memories

Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
Hope decays
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
"Now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back"
"Everything falls apart, even the people"

"Everything falls apart, even the people"

You
Like separate chambers of the human heart
And I'm about to break)
I don't know what to take

It's all too much to take in
When a man has plans of being rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
And I protect you out of courtesy
You will understand
Let down and lived and let go
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
'Cause you can't come back around here
And if I do what you demand
The moon's gonna owe it one
"Sharp edges have consequences, I"
"'Cause I was there, saying"
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
"I can't feel the way I did, before"
The little things give you away
And say what I don't mean
Another wave of tension has more than filled me up
""
This melody will bring you right back home
To prove me wrong
"I wanna heal, I wanna feel"
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
"I will break away, I'll find myself today"
Far from the world of you and I
"(No, no turning back, now)"
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger

Is be more like me and be less like you!
Each word gets lost in the echo

Erase myself

Forget our possibilities
"It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back"
"And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed"
I'm about to break)
What I've done
Why is everything so heavy?
But it all comes back to me in the end
"No matter what I do, how hard I (Try)"
And show me how to be whole again
While you debate what it could take to instigate a war?
""
"When you feel you're alone, cut off from this cruel world"
Actin' like I was part of your property
But something made me realize
(Don't you come back no more)
But all the things I couldn't understand
"Do you see the soldiers that are out, today?"
"I've given up, I'm sick of feeling"
"I am so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger"
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
"It was bullshit then, I guess it makes sense now"
"And blew away as I collapsed, so cold"
I don't need you anymore
I don't know what's worth fighting for
"Gimme my space back, you gotta just (Go)"
"Gonna run away, gonna run away"
Maxed out so now we finished
"So, one last lie I can see through"
Means you gotta keep puttin' me down
Giving up a part of me
"I used to be my own protection, but not now"
To have someone to come home to
"Not a born leader, I'm a tough act to follow"
Making your heart stop
Of bridges I have burned
"How to fall in line, how there's no other way"
In my living room watching but I am not laughing
And the ground caved in
Of a lonesome defeat
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
Is I can't add up to what you can
The sun goes down
So push the button let the whole thing blow
I'm about to break
The blood of innocence burning in the skies
"So let me break this fucker down for you, I really don't know you"
You do favors and then rapidly
"Confusing, confusing what is real"
The little things give you away
I can't tell you how to make it (Go)
To symphonies of blinding light!
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
You like to think you're never wrong
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at
There will be a day
"He hand-wrote a quote, inside"
"'Cause inside, I realize"
The face inside is right beneath your skin
"Time won't heal this damage, anymore"
All the ways that I keep losing you
The sacrifice is never knowing
Couldn't remember where I'd been that night
I woke up driving my car
Nobody's listening
Forget our possibilities
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme I'm dumping
I've put my trust in you
And the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
Remember all the sadness and frustration
I'm holding on to what I haven't got
With thoughts of failure sinking in
And Im counting down the time
""
""
""
Don't stay
Looking so dissatisfied
Sinking down and waiting for the chance to feel alive
(Na-na na na)
I know the words we said
""
I'm dancing with my demons
"Start trying to catch up, motherfucker!"
And six feet underground
""
I can't convince you to just believe this is real
Everyone feels so far away from me
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
Half the words don't mean a thing
Was someone to truly look up to you
And you were there at the turn
"Lift me up, let me go"
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
(You think you won)
"When things go wrong, I pretend the past isn't real"
"I can't feel the way I did, before"
(Told you everything loud and clear) But nobody's listening
"Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time"
"Sharp edges have consequences, I"
That I couldn't be around
If my armor breaks
Set this silence free
"When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done"
Pushed as far as I can go
"I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress"
"We said it was forever, but then it slipped away"
Of a time when I tried so hard
But now I have some clarity
(Just give me myself back and)
"But in the end, it doesn't even matter"
I'll take everything from the inside
(Myself from what I've done)
"One minute, youre on top"
""
I'll face myself
I'm telling you that I see it right through you
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me
I know I'm not the center of the universe

I was not mad at you
(Wooh!)
"Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest"
""
And the memory now is like the picture was then
Until it's gone
""
""
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
"I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone"
As time began to blur
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Keep that in mind
"And six feet underwater, I do"
"You, now I see, even when I close my eyes"
But enough pride inside not to let that show
"It can't be outrun, no!"
I mean nothing to you

"I'd see you in every thought I had, and then"
(You think you won)

Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
Generations disappear
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
Right now
"I don't roll over, don't know how"
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain
"But in the end, it doesn't even matter"
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sometimes I'm

You want someone to hurt like you
Give it all away
Opposite of weak

Let me take back my life
The very worst part of you

And I'm about to break)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you
Who cares if one more light goes out?

Wish I could find a way to disappear
Giving up a part of me
"No, you don't know what you've got"
What I want you to feel
There's more than one of you
"Find another place, to feed your greed"
I wanna heal
And drop me down to the dream below
"It can't be outrun, no!"
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
And my eyes are wide awake
And only I can save me now

I just laughed because what do they know?
If you haven't heard yet then I'm letting you know
It's out of my control
Oh I'll be sorry for now
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high
'Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
"On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day"
It can't be outdone

Did my time with my cellmate

For my battle symphony

The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Missed your shot)

Shut up
"So get with the combat, I'm letting 'em know"
I need a little room to breathe

And in spite of all I should've done
"Fire on the way, make you all say whoa"
"My debt, repaid"
Should've played it safer from the start

"No, you can tell 'em all now"

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
I know Ill never trust a single thing you say
"Heart full of pain, head full of stress"
That I couldn't be around
"While you're waiting for a purpose, I already got mine"
"'Cause inside, I realize"
I don't fold up and I don't bow
You take away if I give in
"I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right"
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
Why is everything so heavy?
"Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight"
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
"You (No turning back, now)"
Why does it feel like night today?
Don't stay
"At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)"
And the sun will set for you
"If I fall, get knocked down"
This is the last smile
Is to feel like Im not stepped on
"And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own"
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
"Makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part"
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
Holding on
But only I can save me!

I've been here killing it
And your paranoia's probably worse
"Blackout, blood in your eye!"

Let me say goodbye to my past life
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple

"All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between"
I can't wait to see tomorrow

If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high
From the front to the back and the side to side
Come apart

What am I leaving when I'm done here?

Knowing as soon as the dough or the deal peak
And in spite of all I should've done

Hold myself up and love my scars

I close both locks below the window
'Cause nobody can save me
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
As the ocean opens up to swallow you

'Cause I'm the one at fault

You were dead wrong

It never goes away

Hardly anything else I need to be

Handful of anger held in my chest

A breath to build a glow

I can't seem to convince myself (Why)

In disbelief I didn't know
Wondering what I think of you

There was nothing in sight
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
Love keeps us kind
