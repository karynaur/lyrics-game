(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
With a hand full of beans
It won't be long before she falls out of love
You gon' have to take your ass home
Somebody told me it was pointless for me to come back
"And even though I sin, maybe we are born to live"
Rockin with our city like a sold out show
"But exceptions can be made, baby, ?cause you're too damn fly"
"Well, baby, you can have it all"
"'Cause I'll beat it up (I'll beat it up, yeah)"
Cause you thought there was more to us but you knew how this would end
So she don't waste her time
""
"I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe"
"You know how she get down, pop it for a check now"
I'm terrified to get my heart broke
I'm not allowed to regret my choice
"My love, my love"
And let the wildfire shine
You told me that you left it all behind
"Cause all I see are wings, I can see your wings"
'Til the ending of our credits
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
"Yeah, we still tippin'"
Just let me motherfucking love you
Don't make this shit my fault
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la"
I chose the life
""
"In my dark times, maybe this is all I could be"
You gotta pay with your body
"You look into my eyes, you can't recognize my face"
I thought I told you
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
Laisse tomber les filles
""
"So she don't waste her time, oooh"
And now I know relationship's my enemy
Hope I make it home
Every Thursday
