Tonight I'll need you to stay

So I stopped by to let you know
"Where we're from, there's no sun, our hometown's in the dark"
Living like a ghost
What they throw at me's too slow
"For now, I will stay alive"
Just like a vertical locomotive

"Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm"

Your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry

A train from the sky
"I will set my soul on fire, what have I become? I'm sorry"

So I'm takin' my time on my ride
'Cause I'm awful just to see

Why am I not scared in the morning?
Go ahead and make me look away
"Oh, yeah!"
Though I am running to you
"Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound"
I haven't found a drop of you
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two

I can feel your breath
You reached in the back and buckled up your heart
Made it this f?

Now everybody knows

Of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded

That's a train
It was a little dark so he held a makeshift torch
"My brain has given up, white flags are hoisted"
I'm open a moment and closed when you show it
"Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle"
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Think things on the brink of blasphemy

Cold nights under siege from accusations

A defense mechanism mode

Won't you go to someone else's dreams?

"Locomotive, my motives are insane"
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
My pride is no longer inside

Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist
"Empty sky, no way, that's me, cause the other half of my heart's asleep"

Silent in the trees

But from the things that work there are only two
"East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low"
"I've got two faces, Blurry's the one I'm not"

Let it be said what the headache represents

"Okay, friend?"
"Heard you say, ""Not today"""

Lips are chapped and faded (faded)

Sippin' on straight chlorine

Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain

Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
Every time I feel selfish ambition is taking my vision
"Stay alive, stay alive for me"
The breath I saw was not my own
"Be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon"
"I would get messed up, weigh 153"
My house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof
Oh I'm standing in front of you

Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
"Deny, deny, denial"

Moving hastily

We had to steal him from his fate
You don't need to run
But I'll fall in line
I'm standing in front of you
Cobwebs and flies come out
"I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late"
"He leaves a lot, his name is Hope"
"But I know, we've made it this far... kid"
I will make you believe you are lovely
(Down! Down! Reign!)
I don't know if this song
I will make you queen of everything you see
"All my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)"
I wish she knew you (I wish she knew you)
"But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man"
Travelin' around this sun
And all my hairs abandoned all my body
You were one of those classic ones
"I don't mind at all, lean on my pride"
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
And I'll fake you out
"Pet cheetah, cheetah"
Set me free
But I know that I'm goin' low
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Eh, eh, eh, eh)"
Even when I doubt you
Feel my conscience wearing thin
"You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified"
"I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep"
""
"Yeah, yeah!"
""
'Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need
I don't know if this one
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone
Won't you tell us of the clouds?
""
Please lead me to the Promised Land
"Da da, da da da, da-da)"
"Though I am bruised, face of contusions"
"I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition"
"I don't mind at all, lean on my pride"
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
Is far from this moment
"I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady"
""
"There's no above, or under, or around it"
"Go away, go away, go away, go away"
You don't need to run
""
Tsae eurt daeh dna amed evael lliw uoy
You don't know the half of the abuse
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
"So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'"
One thing consists of consistence
"Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'"
I know I haven't been the best of sons
But you have lost your sway and glow
"I could give up, and boost up my reputation"
You say things with your mouth
Don't let me be gone
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(I'll fake you out)
""
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
Yeah yeah yeah
"If I keep moving, they won't know"
They will not take you down
Because a chair now
Flies and cobwebs unwind
I haven't found a drop of you
And it's our hearts that make the beat
""
'Cause I'm not sure I want to give you
And honestly
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
So lose your mind
Tonight I'll need you to stay!
""
""
(They know)
"Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
(You don't need to run)
He's been around so long
The lead is terrible in flavor
They know that it's almost
"We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny"
The air begins to feel a little thin
There were people back home who tried talkin' to you
"Beat is a chemical, yeah"
And when your father turns to stone
Don't trust a perfect person an' don't trust a song that's flawless
Underneath the insane asylum
My prayers schizophrenic
Don't want to know who I would be
But I can hear my way around
"Don't trust a perfect person an' don't trust a song that's flawless, honest"
All I wanna
He stays home from work this time
""
""
""
Don't be gone
I'm a ban?I'm a bandito
I'll grab my light
"If I keep moving, they won't know"
"But until that time, I'll try to sing this"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
"I wanted to be a better brother, better son"
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt
"Release me from the present, I'm obsessin', all these questions"
I can't see past my own nose
They want to make you forget
So I'm takin' this moment to live in the future
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
""
I have committed
"Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions"
"For you, I know"
""
""
"Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus"
You think twice about your life
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)
You've got one time to figure it out
Would I just change what I've told my friends?
"So won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye?"
Just pleading that it does not get glorified
Takin' my time on my ride
""
""
"Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message, man"
"When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out"
I cut my lip
"Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges"
Those crazy words they were spelling
""
""
I want to stop time
"I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out"
"Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's"
Singing songs that nobody wrote
Your grandpa died when you were nine
""
That you all have guns
"Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet"
""
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
And I'll break down
"She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive"
"But friend, please don't take your life away from me"
Will help us get ours as we're growing
"She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther"
"You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy"
And I'll be holding onto you
Let's go outside and all join hands
I've used up all I've collected
That it will never happen again
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
An' we'll make money selling your hair
Though I'm weak and beaten down
"Wait, habits here too, youre the worst, your structure compensates"
Walking through the fairgrounds
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
"""Follow me instead"""
"Stay with me, no, you don't need to run"
"I've raised him, and bathed him, and named him Jason"
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Cause the next moment before you know it
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Than I've ever been
I'm trying to be so cool
""
"(Eh, eh, eh, eh)"
"Better I am, gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?"
"I'm fairly local, I've been around"
"Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet"
""
"I have these thoughts so often, I ought"
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
We have a list of people that we would take
"Na-na-na-na, ooh-oh"
"Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?"
Haven't you taken enough from me?
They think its messed up to sell out for your girl
I do not know why I would go
"I'll tell 'em, you have no plans for me, I will set my soul on fire"
(Neon gravestones try to call for my bones)
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
It could make him afraid of his music
Sending signals and red flags in waves
I don't believe the hype
I'm standing in front of you
""
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Neon gravestones try to call
Sippin' on straight chlorine
I know my soul's freezing
""
Tonight I'll need you to stay
Spirits in the dark are waiting
And I haven't found a drop of life
""
If I lose to myself
I keep on goin' back
And energy
""
Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
"Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead"
Is that who I truly am? I truly don't have a chance
Down
"If I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead"
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
"Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me"
""
I don't understand why everything I adore
Don't let me be!
I swear I heard demons yelling
""
"(Eh, eh, eh, eh)"
I'm double-sided
"Yo, this song will never be on the radio"
(I'll fake you out)
'Cause they know that when it goes out
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
"Venom on my tongue, dependent at times"
"I've always been collected, calm and chill"
And the light will set us free
""
"Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead"
I am simply very perplexed by your ways
Domingo en fuego
My friends and I have problems
"Where we're from, we're no one, our hometown's in the dark"
