I wanna fall inside your ghost
And fill up every hole inside my mind
And I want everyone to know
That I am half a soul divided

"Sometimes, we will die"
"And sometimes, we will fly away"
"Either way, you're by my side"
Until my dying days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
"I said ""Don't be afraid"""
"I said ""Don't be afraid"
"We're going home"""
""
I wanna strip myself of breath
A breathless piece of death I've made for you
A mortal rotting piece of song
Will help me carry on
But this you heard

"Sometimes, we will die"
"And sometimes, we will fly away"

Okay
So the hearse ran out of gas
A passenger person grabbed a map
And the driver inside it
Contrived a new route to save the past
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab
A beautifully plain taxi cab
"A cab, had a cleared out back"
And two men started to unpack
Driving once again
"But now this time, there were three men"
And then I heard one of them say
"""I know the night will turn to gray"
I know the stars will start to fade
When all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate
"So he could see another day."""
And then I cracked open my box
Someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot
Where my fingernails had fought
Then I pushed it open more
Pushing up against the door
Then I sat up off the floor
And found the breath I was searching for
Then there were three men up front
All I saw were backs of heads
And then I asked them
"""Am I alive and well, or am I dreaming dead?"""
Then one turned around to say
"""We're driving toward the morning sun"
Where all your blood is washed away
"And all you did will be undone."""
""
"I said ""Don't be afraid"""
"I said ""Don't be afraid"""
Now is the climax to the story
That gives the demons and angels purpose
They fly around while we are walking
And mold our emotions just to please them
""
"I am cold, can you hear?"
I will fly with no known fear
And the ground taunts my wings
"Plummet as I sing, plummet as I sing"
""
All we are is an isle of flightless birds
We find our worth in giving birth and stuff
We're lining our homes against winding roads
And we think the going is tough
We pick songs to sing
Remind us of things that nobody cares about
And honestly
We're probably more suicidal than ever now
If you decide to live by
What you think's wrong and what's right
"Believe me, you'll begin to wish you were sleeping"
Your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry
But if we wake up every morning
And decide what we believe
We can take apart our very heart
And the light will set us free
""
"I am cold, can you hear?"
"I will fly with no hope, no fear"
And the ground taunts my wings
"Plummet as I sing, plummet as I"
""
"I am cold, can you hear?"
"I will fly with no hope, no fear"
And the ground taunts my wings

How frustrating and so degrading
"His time, we're wasting"
As time will fly by
And the sky will cry as light is fading
And He is waiting
"Oh, so patiently"
While we repeat the same routine
As we will please comfortability
And please don't think about
Why you can't sleep in the evening
And please don't be afraid
Of what your soul is really thinking
Your soul knows good and evil
Your soul knows both sides
And it's time you pick your battle
"And I promise you, this is mine"
"I promise you, this is mine"
Your grandpa died when you were nine
They said he had lost his mind

You should never trust the Pantaloon

Now it's your turn to be alone
Find a wife and build yourself a home

He's seen too many stare downs
Between the sun and the moon
In the morning air
How he used to hustle all the people
Walking through the fairgrounds
He's been around so long
He's changed his meaning of a chair now
Because a chair now
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end can't come soon enough
But is it too soon?
Either way he can't deny
He is a Pantaloon

Inside your head than the winter of dead

And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light comes from just the right side

It's the same game today as it always is
I don't give you space to speak my name explaining this
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines
That remind me of all the times...
I have committed
Dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted
To what I've done and what I'm doing
I'm brewing and losing and spewing and fusing
"And believe me, that's what all the kids are doing"
What kids are doing
They're killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoner cell
And if you're one of them then you're one of me
And you would do almost anything just to feel free...

The air begins to feel a little thin
As I start the car and then I begin
To add the miles piled up behind me
I barely feel a smile deep inside me
And I begin to envy the headlights driving south
I want to crack the door so I can just fall out
But then I remember when you packed my car
You reached in the back and buckled up your heart
For me to drive away with
I began to understand why God died

The demon sat there waiting on her porch
It was a little dark so he held a makeshift torch
And when my car was far out of sight
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night

And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own

He never really told his wife

No one really knows his mind

That shade has turned to red

"Ruby, take my hand"
Please lead me to the Promised Land

You're an angel fallen down
Won't you tell us of the clouds?
You have fallen from the sky

You're true and pure
You hold the cure
We're all diseased

There's miles of land in front of us
And we're dying with every step we take
We're dying with every breath we make
And I'll fall in line
A stranger's back is all I see
He's only a few feet in front of me
And I'll look left and right sometimes
But I'll fall in line
No one looks up anymore
Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye
And Heaven forbid they see you cry
As we fall in line
And about this time of every year
The line will go to the ocean pier
And walk right off into the sea
And then we fall asleep
""
And as we near the end of land
And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand
"I ask myself the question ""why I fall in line"""
And then out of the corner of my eye
I see a spaceship in the sky
And hear a voice inside my head
"""Follow me instead"""
"""Follow me instead"""
"""Follow me instead"""
"""Follow me"""
""
Then the wages of war will start
Inside my head with my counterpart
And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase
"""This line's the only way"""
And then I start down the sand
My eyes are focused on the end of land
But again the voice inside my head says
"""Follow me instead"""
"""Follow me instead"""
"""Follow me"""
"""Follow me instead"""
"""Follow me instead"""
"""Follow me instead"""
"""Follow me instead"""
"""Follow me instead"""
""
"Take me up, seal the door"
I don't want to march here anymore
I realize that this line is dead
So I'll follow you instead
So then you put me back in my place
So I might start another day
And once again I will be
In a march to the sea
I know you're not a liar and I know you could set fire this day
Go ahead and make me look away
"Strike me down, I am calling your lightning down from your dark hiding place"
Go ahead and show me your face

Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down (Reign down)

I mean no disrespect
I am simply very perplexed by your ways
Why would you let us use your name?

Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me

Reign down (Down!)
Reign down (Down!)

Don't wanna call you in the nighttime

You say things with your mouth
Cobwebs and flies come out
I hear a second voice
Behind your tongue somehow
Luckily I can read your mind
Flies and cobwebs unwind
They will not take you down
"They will not cast you out, out"
""
"Dear friend, here we are again"
Pretending to understand how you think your world is ending
Sending signals and red flags in waves
It's hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days
I'll pray that one day you'll see
The only difference between life and dying
"Is one is trying, that's all we're called to do"
So try to love me and I'll try to save you

I don't fall slow like I used to
I fall straight down
You've stolen my air catcher
That kept me safe and sound
My parachute's what got me
Safely to ground
But now the cord's not working
And I see you staring me down

I won't fall in love with falling
"I will try to avoid those eyes, oh"

I think you would beat the moon in a
Pretty contest
And the moon just happened to be the
Very first thing that I missed
I was doing fine on my own and there
Wasn't much I lacked
But you've stolen my air catcher
And I don't know if I want it back

I won't fall in love with falling
I will try to avoid those eyes
'Cause I'm not sure I want to give you
Tools that can destroy my heart

And I just don't say what you wanna hear
So I'll write my fears
And I don't believe in talking just to breathe
And falling selfishly

I won't fall in love with falling
I will try to avoid those eyes
But now I'm here to give you words as
Tools that can destroy my heart
