So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight."""

Whether things are good or bad
I see the blood on the leaves
"I'm calling your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?"
"Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?"
Right now
""
"Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains"
That's just some Ye shit
""
"Pardon, I'm getting my scream on (Black)"
"Uh, she cut from a different textile"
"I wish my trainer would, tell me what I overate"
It's somethin' that you need to have
When no one ain't around (I feel it's fadin')
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can we get much higher? So high
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
Man I'm the macho like Randy
"Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson"
Bam bam 'ey 'ey 'ey
And a gnashin' of teeth (Swerve)
"Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)"
And it's rich nigga racism
""
Just play piano and stick to karate
"If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist"
Find yourself up in the food court
"Yeah, I feel you burning, everything's burning"
"Your chick, she so thirsty (Swerve)"
"Okay, I don't remember where we first met"
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
White girls politickin': that's that Sarah Palin
You see it's broke nigga racism
"Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher"
You break a glass and say it again
"I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed"
I can't handle no liquor
"For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way"
"The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head"
"Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost"
"I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks"
"Fucking ridiculous, you know this shit is fucking ridiculous"
Who will survive in America?
"That ain't right, girl"
"Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help"
"Takin' all the stacks, oh"
"It's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know"
""
"Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!"
I remember rappin' for Jay and Cam
"I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?"
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
"Wherever we go, we do it pronto, it's like?"
"You got a new friend ? well, I got homies"
"Work it, make it, do it, makes us"
"Welcome to the good life, where niggas who sell D"
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
"You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."""
"Crazy, that medulla oblongata"
And a gnashin' of teeth (Swerve)
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
"No other help I know, I stretch my hands"
"And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry!"
"And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face"
"And the hell, it wouldn't spare us"
Pour out my feelings
"Then you can't tell me nothing, right?"
