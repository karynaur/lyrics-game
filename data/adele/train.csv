"Hello, it's me"
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
"They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing"
"Hello, can you hear me?"
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
""
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
""
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
"But when I call, you never seem to be home"
Hello from the outside
"At least, I can say that I've tried"
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
"But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore"
""
"Hello, how are you?"
"It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry"
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
""
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
""
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
"But when I call, you never seem to be home"
Hello from the outside
"At least, I can say that I've tried"
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
"But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore"
""
"(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)"
"Ooh, anymore"
"(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)"
"Ooh, anymore"
"(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)"
"Ooh, anymore"
"(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)"
Anymore

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
"Old friend, why are you so shy?"
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
""
"I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited"
"But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it"
I had hoped you'd see my face
"And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over"
""
"Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
"I wish nothing but the best for you, too"
"""Don't forget me,"" I beg"
"I'll remember, you said"
"""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."""
"""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."""

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
""
"I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited"
"But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it"
I had hoped you'd see my face

"""Don't forget me,"" I beg"
"I'll remember, you said"
"""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."""
""
"Nothing compares, no worries or cares"
"Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made"
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
"They've all been said before, you know"
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?
""
"Look, don't get me wrong"
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
""
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
""
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
"And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me"
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
"Tell me, who do I run to?"
""
"Look, don't get me wrong"
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
""
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use

""
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't want to be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
"'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true"
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
"My God, this reminds me"
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
"We were sad of getting old, it made us restless"
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
"To when you were there, to when you were there"
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
"'Cause I still care, do you still care?"

There's a fire starting in my heart
"Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark"
"Finally, I can see you crystal clear"
"Go ahead and sell me out, and then I'll lay your ship  bare"
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

"Just look and you will see I will be, I will be"
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
"I promise you will see that I will be, I will be"
I will be your remedy
"Ohhh, ohhh"
Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
"All that I say, you always say more"

I can't keep up with your turning tables
"Under your thumb, I can't breathe"

"So, I won't let you close enough to hurt me"
"No, I won't rescue you to just desert me"
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables

"Under haunted skies, I see you"
"Ooh, where love is lost, your ghost is found"
I braved a hundred storms to leave you

Lose myself in time

"You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said"

Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
That I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
"But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and manmade"
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch

When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea

Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind

My dignity's become undone

Just a vague and broken boy instead

"I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you"

Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your walls around me pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then but now I'm willing to learn

But we had time against us and miles between us
"The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless"
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up

"I thought I told you, he'd be home soon"
"Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true"
"I fall short each time, every time he ain't here"
"You and your charm creep closer, closer and near"
"Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all"
"Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call"
"You're the wiser one, disguised from greed"
And I'm just a child who longs on her knees
""
But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you
""
So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
"To whisper, ""Will you leave your man?"""
'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I won't stand by you
""
'Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

I ain't yours for no taking
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes
And settle for wrong and ignore the right

When I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did before
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down
"Look how you want me now, but I don't need you"
"Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?"
It's been there for days on end
And it's been waitin' for you to open up yours too
"Baby, come on now, I'm trying to tell you just how"
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me
""
That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you
""
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
"This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me"
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me
""
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough?
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm takin' these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hopin' one day I might hear you say
""
I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more

""
"But, despite the truth that I know"
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
"Like the meaner you treat me, more eager I am"
To persist with this heartbreak of runnin' around
And I will do until I find myself with you
""
And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
"When night comes, and you're on your own"
"You can say, ""I chose to be alone"""
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top
""
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
"There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned"
So wipe that dirty smile off
"We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out"
And now I've had enough of love
""
Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down?
You give up everything you are
"And even then, you don't get far"
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things
""
"See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired"
"There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned"
So wipe that dirty smile off
"We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out"
"And now, I've had enough of (love)"
""
Go ahead and steal my heart to make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt as much it did then
"When we were both right, and no one had blame"
"But now, I give up on this endless game"
""
'Cause who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
"When night comes, and I'm on my own"
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top

This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
"Who blew me away, blew me away"
And It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
"And buried them away, buried them away"
""
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
"But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day"
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
""
Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watched you wave and watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
"That I call home, I call that home"
""
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
"But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day"
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
""
Woke up feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back to where I started
"The morning rain, the morning rain"
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
"It's calling me home, it's calling me home"
""
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
"But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day"
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away
"Aye, aye, aye-aye"
"Aye, aye, aye-aye"
"Aye, aye, aye-aye"
"Aye, aye, aye-aye"

You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
"You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that"
"I think you're giving nothing way too much, in fact"
I say we've only known each other a year
"You say, ""*Pfft*, I've known you longer, my dear"""
"You like to be so close, I like to be alone"
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
"Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all"
"But we do, but we do, do-do-do"
"But we do, but we do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do"
""
"I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more"
"I've never known this, never before"
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
"You're so provocative, I'm so conservative"
"You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining"
"You'd think we wouldn't, we do, but we do, do-do-do"
"But we do, but we do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do"

"Aye, aye, aye-aye"
"Aye, aye, aye-aye"
"Your, your-your, your"
"Your, your-your, your..."
Favoritism ain't my thing but
"In this situation, I'll be glad"
Favoritism ain't my thing but
"In this situation, I'll be glad to make an exception (Woah, oh)"

You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it 'round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too when

"Time and time again, I play the role of fool"

And even in the daylight when your gaming

Hold my hand
While you cut me down
It'd only just begun
But now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments
With your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle
Watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes
You were smiling in the spotlight
Dancing with the night
The night fell off your mind
""
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
"And for what, and for what, and for what"
When I don't get nothing back
"Boy, I'm tired"
""
Where'd you go
When you stay behind
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
"A double taking, punching hard"
And laughing at my smile
I get closer
You obviously prefer her

I'm tired of trying

I should have known

Never mind
Said your open arms
I couldn't help believe
The trick me back into them

Thank you for the time I've been given
"Thank you to everybody for your love and kindness, for your honesty and persuasion"
Thank you for telling me how it is but entertaining what I wanted it to be
Thank you for listening and for letting me into your lives again
Love Adele x
Never would've hitchhiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Would've been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
""
Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

Never would've gone to that side of town
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've took a mind to track him down
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've loaded up a forty-four
And put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

When we used to say goodnight
I'd always kiss and hold you tight
But lately you don't seem to care
You close the door
And leave me standing there
"Oh, honey"
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on
""
The other night we had a date
And you showed up two hours late
And though your hair was all in place
Somebody smeared their lipstick on your face
"Oh, they smeared it"
Every place
Yeah that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on
Oooohhhh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble and fall
But if I can't have you the way I want you
I don't want you at all

"Baby, I can take a lot"
'Cause I love everything you got
Though your kisses fill me
So if you got someone else
I gotta go
"Oh, that you know"
Yeah that's it honey

Oooohhhh
Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life
Ooh
Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me
I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel
Leave
I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
So scratch my itch and beat my drum
So i can start to begin what's begun
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
Ooh
Scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with the words that cry
How I still try to stay inside
""
Hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
"Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts"
Our hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder

Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd have made
But as time goes on and my age gets older
"I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest"

You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
