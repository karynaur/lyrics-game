Your name
Your name
When it crumbles
""
The night fell off your mind
I will be your remedy
""
"Why do you love me, do you love me?"
Of when we were young
So wipe that dirty smile off
We will stand tall
"You set me free, oh"
""
Lay me down (I can baby)
Didn't I give it all? Tried my best
Hit me like an explosion
Fed up of biding your time
"There was something in the water, now that something's in me"
That you are in my life
""
He is a real lover
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
He can't do it on his own
""
But rumour has it (rumours)
""
""
"I'm trying to be brave, stop asking me to stay"
Binlerce kez aram? olmalym
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
I feel like my life is flashing by
The trick me back into them
But I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
And where does the time go?
I quit I'm movin' on
Why do you love me?
Of when we were young
"If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
""
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
I can't go back to the river
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
""
You look like a movie
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Soaking up the sun
I'm giving you up
"But rumour has it, I'm the one you're leaving her for"
"If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
"The scars of your love, they leave me breathless"
When we were younger and free
"I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest"
You know I know just how you feel
"You've ignited a spark, let the fires away"
Let the sky fall
"It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands"
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
"To whisper, ""Will you leave your man?"""
But you still went for the kill
What lovers do
How it feels to hold you close?
""
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
I quit I'm movin' on
Walk that mile
I'll always love you
"Whichever road I choose, you'll go"
""
Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
""
"I thought I told you, he'd be home soon"
"Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance"
"Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust"
"But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and manmade"
God only knows
"This ain't easy, it's not meant to be, every story has its scars"
""
"I'll remember, you said"
Give me a memory I can use
You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Keeping me from harm
I won't go
Let this be the way we remember us
We both know we ain't kids no more
But we had time against us and miles between us
"Boy, I'm tired of trying"
Painting pictures
But rumour has it (rumours)
It'd only just begun
""
So wipe that dirty smile off
Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa-oh)
I've imagined it all
"No, I won't rescue you to just desert me"
(Treat her better)
"But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore"
Let the sky fall
You still sound like a song
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
"At least, I can say that I've tried"
Never mind
So if you got someone else
"Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call"
"Oh if only, if only you knew"
I know I left you speechless
When it crumbles
Send my love to your new lover
Until the end starts
Without me knowing
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
"And for what, and for what, and for what"
But now it's over now
"Sometimes, I wake up by the door"
The reason you loved me before
Rumour has it (rumours)
""
""
Without the security
The last time
I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
""
"The scars of your love, they leave me breathless"
"Lights go down, lights go down"
""
"When night comes, and you're on your own"
Maybe I should leave to help you see
Hello from the other side
(You're gonna wish you ? never had met me)
Turning tables
""
Then sees you through
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
""
But I want to live and not just survive
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
"Please don't fall apart, I can't face your breaking heart"
""
"When it fell, something died"
So i can start to begin what's begun
Who knows why I love you
"Ah, artk de?il"
I'm between the middle
Let it burn
You've burnt my heart to stone
Four cold walls against my will
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
If it hadn't been for love
I feel like my life is flashing by
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
I know I'm not the only one
"Baby, don't let the lights go down"
"Lights go down, lights go down"
""
I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
"If this ain't love, then what is?"
That's not fair
(When we were young)
And now I've had enough of love
""
We could have had it all
And we'll stand
"Your, your-your, your..."
The one that I belong to
We could have had it all
We will stand tall
The River Lea-ea-ea
"Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips"
Everything I do is for you
You may have my number
You make me feel like I am whole again
I won't go
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
"Finally, I can see you crystal clear"
I should have known
"Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?"
(When we were young)
Like when we creep out when she ain't around
Lay me down (I can baby)
She is half your age
You can find him sitting on your doorstep
"If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
But rumour has it (rumours)
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
To hold in your arms
"Tell me, who do I run to?"
And you played it to the beat
""
"Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love"
"Next time, I'll be braver"
To persist with this heartbreak of runnin' around
I'm the only one in love
And put myself behind a jailhouse door
"But when I call, you never seem to be home"
"Excuse me, first love, but we're through"
You grace me with your cold shoulder
"Mmm, that was what you told me"
Anymore
Of my world
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
But rumour has it (rumours)
"Ama fark etmez, belli ki bu artk seni ?zm?yor"
Be exactly like we were before we realised
Put a kiss on top of your head
""
"Look, don't get me wrong"
"And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over"
""
Painting pictures
""
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
"If this ain't love, then what is?"
You make me feel like I am young again
Diyorlar ki zaman seni iyile?tirmeliymi?
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
""
"And now, I've had enough of?"
There is so much space between us
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
""
""
"At least, I can say that I've tried"
"Bring your heart, I'll bring my soul"
Hold me closer one more time
Close enough to start a war
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
That's what you said when you left me
"Forgive me, first love, but I'm too tired"
"Oh, they smeared it"
"Baby, don't let the lights go down"
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
"'Cause, baby, I'm in deeper than I knew"
I will be your remedy
I can't love you in the dark
"And for what, and for what, and for what"
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
""
"No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips"
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
I've forgiven it all
But rumour has it (rumours)
'Cause it will never hurt as much it did then
Face it all together
Thank you for listening and for letting me into your lives again
"Okay, cool"
""
I've seen your face under every sky
Rumour has it (rumours)
Even though everything's a strain
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
All I ask is
When the night keeps you from sleeping
"Whatever words I say, I will always love you"
You shower me with words made of knives
The one that shoots me each and every time
Your one and only
And everything you do's a game
""
"However far away, I will always love you"
"Of my world, yeah"
""
At the mention of my name?
"The more I do, the less I know"
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Skyfall is where we start
Haven't you heard the rumours?
""
En azndan denedi?imi s??yleyebilirim
""
Do you even know that I can't let go?
"Ooh, anymore"
I set fire to the rain
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
I gave you everything you never gave me
Pacing floors and opening doors
"You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that"
Like notes and clothes you left behind
He can't do it on his own
When I don't get nothing back
Only wanted for you to save me
"It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry"
To hold in your arms
Without one dollar to my name
You say it's all in my head
And you showed up two hours late
"I miss the air, I miss my friends"
"All of my life, I've been frozen"
You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
""
I hid it in the seam of your coat
I want you to love me
When I don't get nothing back
"I can't describe how I feel, it feels right"
""
"They've all been said before, you know"
""
""
""
I build myself up and fly around in circles
"Yeah, of my world"
""
"Lately with this state I'm in, I can't help myself but spin"
"If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
"Under your thumb, I can't breathe"
Lay me down ('til the morning)
If it hadn't been for love
I can't decide if I should run and hide
After all we've been through?
Make a home down there
""
Fed up of biding your time
Please wipe that look out of your eyes
"But when I call, you never seem to be home"
But not if you are so reckless
Who wants to be right as rain?
"Time and time again, I play the role of fool"
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me
""
""
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
"Sana ?zg?n oldu?umu s??ylemek i??in, yapt?m her ?ey adna"
"(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)"
I can't keep up with your turning tables
And you're in the heat of moments
So little to say but so much time
"With his hands behind his back, oh"
River Lea
I know there is no tomorrow
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
""
""
It's better when something is wrong
Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
""
"Oh, oh, oh"
"Hope you know, I won't let go"
"If you're ready, are you ready?"
Running riots inside my soul
"You're my scope of everything, everywhere"
When you'll just crumble back on down?
We play so dirty in the dark
""
And save me boy
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
(Treat her better)
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
""
Favoritism ain't my thing but
And be all you need so that you never want more
Towards me from across the room
"Oh, anymore"
""
"My hands, they were strong"
When I lay with you
You sound like a song
"Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements"
And outside only to find
"""Don't forget me,"" I beg"
Look how you want me now that I don't need you
It turns out it ain't enough?
Even if it leads nowhere?
"Every feeling, every word"
You make it look like I'm see-through
They make believe that everything
""
And I threw us into the flames
What was I thinking? I gave you everything
"Every part of me, all my words to hold"
You had my heart inside of your hand
""
These days when I see you
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
I miss you when the lights go out
"So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride"
""
Throw your soul through every open door (oh-oh)
Will I ever know
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
""
But they don't know you like I do
Lay me down (I can fall in)
"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
Nobody knows it better than me
And I hear your words that I made up
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
""
"Baby, we're already defeated"
I've forgiven it all
I've been here before
But rumour has it (rumours)
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed
""
Lord have mercy on my soul
I get closer
There's too much that I haven't said
Put your hand in my hand
"Baby, please remember me once more"
""
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
"Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds"
I miss you when the lights go out
En azndan denedi?imi s??yleyebilirim
In every face that I've ever known
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you
Filling up my heart with golden stories
I want you to love me
There's a fire starting in my heart
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
"I'll remember, you said"
Just why I want you to love me
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
""
""
"And for what, and for what, and for what"
""
Treat her better
""
I heard you've been missing me
Why do you love me?
You made a fool out of me
"Baby, don't let the lights go down"
But rumour has it (rumours)
Hani hi??bir ?ey olmayan yer?
"""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."""
As mine sure won't be shared
"Whatever it is, I depend on it"
But go on and take it
Just take it
""
(You're gonna wish you ? never had met me)
""
"Baby, come on now, I'm trying to tell you just how"
Watching hastiness unfold
Just a vague and broken boy instead
You close the door
"Look up to the sky, not just the floor"
"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
It is the world to me
I never lied and I never faked it
But not if you are so reckless
But I set fire to the rain
"When it fell, something died"
"At least, I can say that I've tried"
Give me a memory I can use
"Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go"
Everybody loves the things you do
It illuminates all of my doubts
"But when I call, you never seem to be home"
If it hadn't been for love
"And even then, you don't get far"
Don't you remember?
""
"Finally, could this be it, or?"
When we were young
I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away
""
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
Without falling to your feet
"There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned"
Don't need to look no further
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
We will stand tall
I hid it in the seam of your coat
"Hello, can you hear me?"
Treat her better
"Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)"
"You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that"
(You're gonna wish you ? never had met me)
Whenever I'm alone with you
"Love, love"
If it hadn't been for love
Are the wonders of my world
"But go on, go on and take it"
"Are you ready, ready?"
(Bless your soul)
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
Why it's taken me so long
You must be mistaken
We both know we ain't kids no more
It's harder when you're on top
I miss you when the lights go out
""
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
"We were sad of getting old, it made us restless"
To make you feel my love
"Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless"
I'd always kiss and hold you tight
It could be something in the air I breathe
It's been there for days on end
"Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it"
""
(You're gonna wish you ? never had met me)
Lay me down (through the night)
Face it all together
"Harder baby, harder baby"
""
No one knows me like you do
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
'Cause we are living worlds apart
To make you feel my love
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
Never would've caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
You set me free
To bring you back to me
Take it all with you
""
"Baby, don't let the lights go down"
But I know that's just me 'cause nothing ever is enough
The sweetest devotion
At Skyfall
I was a child then but now I'm willing to learn
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah
Even if it leads nowhere?
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
"If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently"
"I love it to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades"
Who wants to be riding high
Our love ain't water under the bridge
""
""
Lay me down (Wont you)
We're willing to take the risk
""
"And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head"
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
"It all, it all, it all"
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
""
But rumour has it (rumours)
You make me feel like I am home again
I'm takin' these chances and getting nowhere
"Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?"
""
To prove I am the one who can
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I heard that your dreams came true
So why don't we just play pretend
""
Send my love to your new lover
To turning tables
(You're gonna wish you ? never had met me)
"Merhaba, beni duyuyor musun?"
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
All I ask is
You make me feel like I am free again
"Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts"
When will I see you again?
"It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat"
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening

Let the sky fall
Just why I want you to love me
"And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head"

"I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you"

Memories are fresh

Why do you love me?
"Please wear the face, the one where you smile"
Take me by the hand while we do
Ooh
Nobody told me that you'd be here
When was the last time you thought of me?
"Learning to fly, learning to run"
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
Your teasing ain't enough
Did you find the note that I wrote?
Your teasing ain't enough
"Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements"
"It only makes it harder, baby"
"Turn, no, no, no-oh"

But be delicate with my ego
Not one resemblance to the man I met

Are running out of time
Tell me to run and I'll race
Never would've gone to that side of town

"Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore"
I want you to love me
I will always love you

We both know we ain't kids no more
I won't go

Favoritism ain't my thing but
"Ama fark etmez, belli ki bu artk seni ?zm?yor"
We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
"That I never knew, never knew"
Di?er taraftan merhaba
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
""
Who regrets the things they've done
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
I miss you when the lights go out
Why do you steal my hand
"Thank you to everybody for your love and kindness, for your honesty and persuasion"
I must've called a thousand times
""
"It was dark, and I was over"
It's already in your eyes
"Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go"
""
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
"Baby, give me light"
Promise I'm worthy
Who regrets the things they've done
"I wish nothing but the best for you, too"
I want you to be my keeper
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Hit me like an explosion
"I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby"
"But go on, go on and take it"
The sweetest devotion
"Oh honey, if Im not the one for you"
You'll never know if you never try
But rumour has it (rumours)
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
Until the end starts
All that I have is on the floor
I had no idea of the state we were in
I'll put my hands up
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
You obviously prefer her
We will stand tall
And if I stay I'll be a lie
"Sometimes, I just feel it's only me"
I'm willing to take the risk
"You would always win, always win"
I hope that you're well
I set fire to the rain
For this is the end
And I threw us into the flames
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
Round my hometown
I'll put my hands up
(You're gonna wish you ? never had met me)
And I swear you'd moved overseas
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
"Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?"
"But it's in my roots, in my veins"
So come on and give me the chance
It illuminates all of my doubts
"Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all"
But rumour has it (rumours)
"Sana ?zg?n oldu?umu s??ylemek i??in, yapt?m her ?ey adna"
Face it all together
What you see I see
Should I leave it there?
"You can read my mind, be it truth or lies"
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
They melt my heart to stone
"Baby, I can take a lot"
I won't rise until this battle's won
How did it slow down? I go round and around
What lovers do
"Wake me up, wake me up when all is done"
""
If it hadn't been for love
Or will he go back to the place where he will choose the poison over me?
There's such a difference between us
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

It matters how this ends
You never seem to make it through the door
""
Found myself today singin' out loud your name
Look how you want me now that I don't need you
"So, desperately, I try to link it with my head"
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
"Baby, give me light"
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I forgive you once again
In case it is the last time that we might
"This ain't lust, I know this is love, but"
Of your loving arms
Hello from the other side
I can't do it on my own
Binlerce kez aram? olmalym

Think of me in the depths of your despair
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Where you go I go

Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
"Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go"

"In this situation, I'll be glad"
"If you're ready, if you're ready"
"Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights"
(You're gonna wish you ? never had met me)
"No, I won't rescue you to just desert me"
"But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it"
On that same old road that brought me here
It's bribing me to doubt myself
Looks good when he walks
Are the wonders of this world
No doubt in my mind where you belong
"You're the wiser one, disguised from greed"
"Turning tables, yeah"
You will only be eternally
"Oh, oh"
You're the only one that I want

"Sana ?zg?n oldu?umu s??ylemeyi, kalbini krd?m i??in"
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I want to see
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life
"Sweetest, it's the sweetest"
Reminded by things I find
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
"Right before my eyes I saw my heart, it came to life"
At Skyfall
With eyes that make you melt
That this would be inevitable

"Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it"
And the games you'd play
"""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."""
But rumour has it (rumours)

"Will he, will he still remember me?"
But rumour has it (rumours)
"Even now, when we're already over"
"Hello, it's me"
To hold in your arms
And it's teasing me
But rumour has it (rumours)
You say my name like there could be an us
"Nothing compares, no worries or cares"
But we had time against us and miles between us
Just take it all with my love
"And boy, she's bringing you down"
Should I leave it there?
Don't pretend that you don't want me

""
I'm tired of trying
""
"And now, I've had enough of love"
"Boy, I'm tired"
Don't pretend that you don't want me

The one that I belong to
I gave you everything you never gave me

But if by chance you're here alone
"Well, it burned while I cried"
"""Don't forget me,"" I beg"
To make you feel my love
"For the big one, for the big jump"
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
"Yes, I swam dirty waters but you pushed me in"
There's no way I could describe him
Would've been gone like a wayward wind
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
"But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day"
"But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it"
"No one has me like you do, baby"
I'll put my hands up
"Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements"
You can take my name
Fed up of biding your time
Thank you for telling me how it is but entertaining what I wanted it to be

So I won't go
So scratch my itch and beat my drum
Leave
Where'd you go
"I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one"

I'm giving you up

Like he's never felt her figure before
"River Lea, River Lea"
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
"Ooh, where love is lost, your ghost is found"
I could offer you a warm embrace
Treat her better
You make me feel like I am fun again
You were smiling in the spotlight
"You and your charm creep closer, closer and near"
"We were sad of getting old, it made us restless"
Say that you love me in your last goodbye

Your body standing over me
"I ain't lost, just wandering"""
"(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)"
'Cause what if I never love again?
Never would've loaded up a forty-four
I've made up my mind

(When we were young)
Hold my hand
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
"In this situation, I'll be glad to make an exception (Woah, oh)"
Lay down with me
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
"Aye, aye, aye-aye"
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

I want you to be my keeper
So stand beside the river you cried
She made a fool out of you
Is the subject of their talk
I heard that you're settled down
I can't help myself from looking for you
Waiting for a surprise
Though I do know how you play
When will I see you again?
When did it go wrong? I will never know

"We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out"
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
I can't do it on my own

"You say, ""*Pfft*, I've known you longer, my dear"""
"Oh, anymore"
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too when
"Sometimes, I just feel it's only me"
Your teasing ain't enough
Let me stay here for just one more night
"Like the meaner you treat me, more eager I am"
Woke up feeling heavyhearted
But lately you don't seem to care
Why don't you remember?
"Oh it's in my roots, in my veins"
I try to think of things to say
I don't need your honesty
The scars of your love remind me of us
The scars of your love remind me of us
I want you to love me
"Just hold me closer, baby"
Hello from the outside
When I don't get nothing back
You drift into my head and
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
I will change if I must
Let it burn
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Thinking about it all the time
"You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said"
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
"See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired"
Why were you so cold? Let the truth be told
I will be your remedy
You shower me with words made of knives
"If this ain't love, then what is?"
If you're not the one for me

The River Lea-ea-ea
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
We will stand tall
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Whenever I'm alone with you
And you played it to the beat
'Cause I found a boy who I love more
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
"Don't try to change my mind, I'm being cruel to be kind"
""
We're not the only ones
"We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out"
Just why I want you to love me
And lay yourself down
"Every feeling, every word"
But I set fire to the rain
"You'd think we wouldn't, we do, but we do, do-do-do"

"Oh, that you know"
"Just look and you will see I will be, I will be"
And lay yourself down

No I'm not gonna do it standing up

"Love you, oh"
"But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day"
"I am ready, ready"

But you'll never have my heart

We will stand tall
You know when to make me imagine you're here
"Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go"
"Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark"

I hid it in the seam of your coat
And he could change the world
Take it all with my love

"Baby, we're already defeated"
My dignity's become undone

I get excitement in my bones

"I promise I'm worthy, mmm"
I find it funny that you're the only one I never looked for

"Ooh, anymore"
Just look and you will see that I will be your remedy

Can I have a moment before I go?
"You like to be so close, I like to be alone"
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
You know how to feel things
And feeling up his girl
But rumour has it (rumours)
Waits for you

The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
If it hadn't been for love
Hello from the outside
"No, we ain't kids no more"
When I don't get nothing back
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
"Baby, don't let the lights go down"
And make me crazy for you
I want you to love me
"I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more"
When it crumbles
"I wish nothing but the best for you, too"
The sweetest devotion I know
Ooh
Just look and you will see that I will be your remedy

"Look up to the sky, not just the floor"
"You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining"
"We were sad of getting old, it made us restless"

"The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless"
D?ardan merhaba
It's harder when you're on top
"Maybe you got too used to, well having me around"
"I miss the air, I miss my friends"
I will always love you
"The morning rain, the morning rain"
"Down, down, down"
Lay me down (I can fall in)
"I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now"
In case it is the last time that we might
Lay me down (Someone believe me)
Which forgive you each time

I make you feel a way you've never felt before
I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
While you cut me down
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
If this is my last night with you
You shower me with words made of knives
I ain't yours for no taking
The sweetest devotion I know
I must've called a thousand times
"I miss my mother, I miss it when"

"I'll remember, you said"
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
Even if it leads nowhere?
Lay me down (Won't you)

Rumour has it (rumours)
Let the sky fall

"I wish nothing but the best for you, too"
Painting pictures
"(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)"
"Your, your-your, your"
I've known it from the moment that we met
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied
If it hadn't been for love
I don't want you at all
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me

Take me by the hand while we do
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
"Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
"It only makes it harder, baby"
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
"It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands"
You're giving up so easily
Let me photograph you in this light
You had my heart inside of your hand
"Doo-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah, yeah"
But rumour has it (rumours)
Whenever I'm alone with you
"Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand"
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
Send my love to your new lover
And It was in the darkest of my days
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Face it all together
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
You give up everything you are
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts

Could have had it all
Do you even know that I can't let go?
Take it all with my love
"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"

Let the sky fall

And I'm just a child who longs on her knees

To forget your past and simply be mine

"I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now"
But rumour has it (rumours)
They can't look me in the eye
And the whole world is on your case
Strips me down bare and gets me into my favourite mood
""
"Ohhh, ohhh"
"And boy, you're bringing me down"
"Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?"
""
The River Lea-ea-ea
"If this ain't love, then what is?"
I can't do it on my own
"Well, it burned while I cried"
"Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand"
""
""
We will stand tall
I will leave my heart at the door
Ama ben pek iyile?medim
But rumour has it (rumours)
"Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand"
When he shouldn't be
"Simply, it's tiring"
Let me photograph you in this light
I grow fonder every day
Where worlds collide and days are dark
""
"Oh, oh, no"
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
"I'll be my own savior, standing on my own two feet"
And have you tell me
The sweetest devotion I know
""
And the games you'd play
"But we do, but we do, do-do-do"
Just take it all with my love
Never would've hitchhiked to Birmingham
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
'Cause I love you
Build your walls around me pull me to the light
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Making memories using my eyes
I'm willing to take the risk
Your teasing ain't enough
And I will do until I find myself with you
""
I'm going back to where I started
""
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
Don't pretend that you don't want me
In the light of day
"Never mind, I'll find someone like you"
But rumour has it (rumours)
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
"They were never true, never true"
""
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd have made
"Your love, it is my truth and I will always love you"
So is it over? Is this really it?
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
Seems I love the things you do
Even if it leads nowhere?
And you played it to the beat
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
And my back begins to tingle
"As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down"
So bad it cuts through the deepest parts of me
Whenever I'm alone with you
""
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
Send my love to your new lover
"So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
You should know I chose to be alone
"Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
"Sweetest, it's the sweetest devotion"
If it hadn't been for love
All the things you'd say
""
""
If it hadn't been for love
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
That's it
I want you to love me
""
So stand beside the river I cried
Everybody taking different sides
And lose yourself in time
People say crazy things
""
""
"Aye, aye, aye-aye"
""
"Baby, give me light"
""
Oooohhhh
Thank you for the time I've been given
That I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
If it hadn't been
"I promise you will see that I will be, I will be"
Fed up of biding your time
I'll put my hands up
And if I'm not the one for you
I won't go
You had my heart inside of your hand
And this is everything we need
(You're gonna wish you ? never had met me)
"Next time, I'll be braver"
I'm giving you up
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
"""Don't forget me,"" I beg"
When it crumbles
"I think you're giving nothing way too much, in fact"
It was just like a song
I don't know why I'm scared
Lay down with me
"But now, I give up on this endless game"
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
""
Crazy for you
""
"Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made"
"However long I stay, I will always love you"
I can't love you in the dark
(When we were young)
Or scared of having nothing left?
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You know my heart more than I do
"It's calling me home, it's calling me home"
"""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."""
When you stay behind
It illuminates all of my doubts
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
"Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be?"
""
"Baby, we're already defeated"
D?ardan merhaba
I only wanted to have fun
"However long I stay, I will always love you"
""
Yeah that's it honey
But he stays all the same
""
"We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out"
In case it is the last time that we might
He would be hard to chase
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
"Merhaba, benim"
Say that it's always been me
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
Bulu?mak ister miydin
"We were the greatest, me and you"
I quit
"I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you"
'Cause there's a side to you
I need to taste the kiss from someone new
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
Face it all together
Who wants to be right as rain?
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
But if I can't have you the way I want you
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Be exactly like we were before we realised
Because I'm too crazy for you
To let my doubts go
"In love, I'm the only one in love"
A million years ago
If this is my last night with you
Rolling in the deep
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There is no simple
Are the wonders of my world
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
"Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless"
You know when to make me imagine you're here
""
Feel you here forever
"This love, it ain't over yet"
It's like they're scared of me
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Lay me down (I can fall in)
""
Send my love to your new lover
I can't do it on my own
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
"Oh it's in my roots, in my veins"
You set me free
You were a shot in the dark that blew me away
""
"I miss my mother, I miss it when"
But they don't recognize me now
(You're gonna wish you ? never had met me)
"Say it ain't so, say it ain't so"
Eskiden kim oldu?umuz hakknda umutsuzca d???n?yorum
And hope that you find the missing piece
I'm still hopin' one day I might hear you say
(Send my love to your new lover)
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
We could have had it all
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
""
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
"I could make you happy, make your dreams come true"
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
""
Let me photograph you in this light
You are the peak and art of my universe
""
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
""
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
There must be something in the water
I don't regret a thing
""
It's so cold in your wilderness
(I don't see through)
(When we were young)
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you
"I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you"
Artk de?il
"(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)"
"Who blew me away, blew me away"
"Aye, aye, aye-aye"
I miss you when the lights go out
When the rain is blowing in your face
"Old friend, why are you so shy?"
""
Said your open arms
Sitting on the sea
It feels like we're oceans apart
"The way I'm running with you, honey"
So wipe that dirty smile off
"But rumour has it, he's the one I'm leaving you for"
Our love ain't water under the bridge
That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
(Send my love to your new lover)
You build me up and leave me there
I'll put my hands up
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
"And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over"
""
"""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."""
""
Round my hometown
"My God, this reminds me"
""
I can't bear this time
Hello from the outside
Are the wonders of my world
But that was a million years ago
To make you feel my love
""
When the world seems so cruel
"Mmm, there's only one way down"
"Oooh, sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark"
You grace me with your cold shoulder
I set fire to the rain
I want you to love me

"However far away, I will always love you"
En azndan sana s??ylemeye ??al?t?m s??yleyebilirim
Don't you remember?
"Why do you love me, do you love me?"
"Ama fark etmez, belli ki bu artk seni ?zm?yor"
"So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
"(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)"
Each and every time I turn around to leave
It feels like we're oceans apart
"And for what, and for what, and for what"
"Baby, give me light"
Our love ain't water under the bridge
"Oooh, I thought I'd die in your arms"
It was just like a movie
"Deep down, I must have always known"
"To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay"
We both know we ain't kids no more
Di?er taraftan merhaba
"But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore"
And a million miles
""
"I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire"
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
I love the way your body moves
"Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements"
"Doo-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah, yeah"
"Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts"
"Come whatever, I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through"
I'm movin' on
"No, I won't rescue you to just desert me"
"This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me"
""
Yani di?er taraftan merhaba
But rumour has it (rumours)

"Look how you want me now, but I don't need you"
(When we were young)
"Time against us, miles between us"
You will only be eternally
'Cause what if I never love again?
Hoping you'll walk through
To forget your past and simply be mine
""
Yeah that's it honey
""
When it crumbles
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Treat her better
Our hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
"You're so provocative, I'm so conservative"
Never would've caught the train to Louisiana
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I have loved you all my life
There will be times we'll try and give it up
Some say I'll be better without you
"And buried them away, buried them away"
I promise you will see that I will be
"I fall short each time, every time he ain't here"
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
"Baby, please remember me once more"
Should I leave it there?
""
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
"Sweetest, it's the sweetest"
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
""
"Why do you love me, do you love me?"
"Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all"
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
And lay yourself down
"All that I say, you always say more"
Even if it leads nowhere?
I met someone by accident
Merak ediyordum e?er bunca yldan sonra
"Mmm, baby, I'm still rising"
"My God, this reminds me"
You'll never know if you never try
We both know we ain't kids no more
"I could stay there, close my eyes"
When the air is so thick and opaque
""
"Don't you ever say my love, ""open up your heart"""
"Sure, she's got it all"
Every place
""
"And if you want me gone, I'll leave"
""
Your one and only
Watched it pour as I touched your face
I often think about where I went wrong
"You're my hope, you're my despair"
Lay me down (Someone believe me)
"I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you"
You made me leave you
The only thing that I want is your love
""
Plus he's there for you
"Please stay where you are, don't come any closer"
Only wanted for you to save me
""
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
You played it to the beat
"Well, it burned while I cried"
Try to understand why
Kendim hakknda konu?mam ne kadar da normal
"Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all"
I want you
And on the highway of regret

"Under haunted skies, I see you"
"Every piece and part, you were the first"
"You and I have history, or don't you remember?"
To prove I am the one who can
"I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited"
If it hadn't been
And I see my future in you
Binlerce kez aram? olmalym
The other night we had a date
I can't help feeling

"Ohhh, ohhh"
But there's a side to you
But when the pain cuts you deep

I'm willing to take the risk
That's why I can't love you in the dark
"Down, down, down"
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
I don't want to be cruel or vicious

How I still try to stay inside
Lay down with me
(When we were young)
Go to the ends of the earth for you
Painting pictures
"Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love, forgive me"
(You're gonna wish you ? never had met me)
But rumour has it (rumours)
"Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go"
""
"I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away"
The crazier I turn into
Rolling in the deep
"""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."""
It illuminates all of my doubts

So wipe that dirty smile off
To turning tables
"A double taking, punching hard"
"Ah, artk de?il"
Why have we been through what we have been through?
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Turn me into a crumblin' fool
When the night keeps you from sleeping
I'm willing to take the risk
If it hadn't been for love
I know there is no tomorrow
Your one and only

And even in the daylight when your gaming
"You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down)"
"So, I won't let you close enough to hurt me"
When it crumbles
"And hold against me, why won't you let it be?"
Just the guitar?
Her ?eyi d???nmek i??in
Send my love to your new lover
And bare my soul
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
But rumour has it (rumours)
"Swept away, I'm stolen"
I want every single piece of you
Then kiss me back to life to see
But I won't go
"No room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned"
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
"??z?r dilerim, kalbini krd?m i??in"
You know when to make me imagine you're here
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

Lay down with me
Rolling in the deep

"If I'm wrong, I am right"
And all I can do is watch and cry

"Turns me crazy, but it's you who makes me lose my head"
"If you're ready, if you're ready"
"This love has dried up, and stayed behind"
Never would've hitchhiked to Birmingham
Do you even know that I can't let go?
When we spoke yesterday
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (oh-oh)

I heard his voice today
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts

Hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Don't pretend that you don't want me

It was just like a movie
"Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love"
Waiting as my heart drops

Lay me down (I can baby)
Gave you the space so you could breathe
Over every border and on every line

"""I'll be home so soon, I won't be late"""
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
You shower me with words made of knives
